Even in a study with 2448 patients, the numbers with a postoperative myocardial infarction, clinical pulmonary embolus, or deep vein thrombosis were insufficient to identify any specific risk factors. Those patients with previous stroke were at increased risk of a second stroke in the postoperative period (4.7, 2.3 to 9.5).\n\n Heart failure and chest infection are thought to be major postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture, 7 8 and our large prospective study confirms this. The demographics of our study population were Survival analysis based on number of preoperative comorbidities similar to previously reported UK studies. 4 9 The 30 day mortality is comparable with that of the Oxford NHS health region from 1984-98 and is also typical of other units within the UK, 9 10 Europe, and the US. 3 7 11 Our most striking result was the high mortality for patients who developed acute heart failure or a chest infection after surgery for hip fracture. In the 30 days after surgery, 13% (334) of our patients developed one of these complications yet they accounted for 73% (169) of the deaths.\n\n Patients with more comorbidities on admission had a greater risk of postoperative complications and increased mortality. This is consistent with results of previous smaller retrospective studies. 8 12 Cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease predispose patients to the most common and serious postoperative complications. These patients may be a target group for specialist preoperative medical assessment.\n\n To reduce mortality, attention must focus on optimising health status preoperatively, preventing postoperative complications, and, when these complications develop, providing optimal specialist medical care. No study has specifically examined high risk patients who may have most to gain from more specialised medical care. The difference in outcome between patients who have access to joint orthopaedic and geriatric care and those who do not has been investigated. 13 14 These studies mainly evaluated interventions related to rehabilitation rather than acute medical assessment and, unsurprisingly, have not shown a significant difference in early mortality. Despite this, as far back as 1989 the Royal College of Physicians recommended medical assessment of patients with hip fracture to reduce their operative risk, 15 and this has been reinforced in several subsequent publications. 16 17 Specialist medical assessment and management of elderly patients with hip fracture before and after surgery, however, remains uncommon in the UK. The resident medical registrar assessed a number of our patients after anaesthetic assessment, and they subsequently underwent surgery. The number assessed was small and most of the patients who died postoperatively had no formal specialist medical assessment before or after surgery.\n\n Further studies would identify optimal management for these patients, but experience suggests that they may benefit from specialist senior medical input both before and after surgery. A retrospective study of over 8000 elderly patients with hip fracture found that perioperative transfusion had no influence on mortality in patients with haemoglobin concentrations > 80 g/l, 18 but smaller studies have shown that transfusion at higher haemoglobin concentrations for patients with known cardiac disease may be beneficial. 19 20 Persistent hypoxia may be present in all patients with hip fracture from the time of admission until up to five days postoperatively, 21 and episodes of myocardial ischaemia occur in postoperative patients with known ischaemic heart disease. 22 Therefore measures such as higher triggers for transfusion and monitoring oxygen saturation and arterial blood gases before and after surgery may help reduce complications.\n\n Invasive physiological monitoring with oesophageal Doppler ultrasonography or pulmonary artery catheters in the perioperative period may be of benefit. 23 In other surgical specialities, outcome is improved in high risk patients undergoing major surgery in whom fluid and inotrope therapy is monitored with pulmonary artery catheters. 24 This has not been extrapolated to orthopaedic surgery. These invasive techniques, however, may be helpful in optimising cardiac output and reducing postoperative cardiac failure in the vulnerable patients we have identified.\n\n It was not possible to have diagnostic criteria driven by protocol, and treatment for each comorbidity and more accurate premorbid data would have been useful-for example, echocardiography to assess the degree of heart failure or lung function tests to define the severity of lung disease. The study was observational and did not look at different systems of care for these patients. However, we did have complete data on a large consecutive series of patients with 100% follow-up for mortality statistics. This study reflects everyday clinical practice in the UK. National audits based on hospital episode statistics, such as those produced by Imperial College and Dr Foster (www.drfoster-.co.uk), provide only crude mortality data. In contrast, we also provided information on comorbidities, complications, and mortality. \n\n We have shown a 9% mortality at 30 days after hip fracture in elderly patients. A fifth of patients had a postoperative complication, the most common being chest infection and heart failure. Within 30 days of surgery 65% of patients with heart failure and 43% with postoperative chest infection died. Most patients (92%) with heart failure died within a year of surgery. Age, male sex, and the presence of three or more comorbidities on admission all predicted a high risk of complications. Further studies are urgently required to evaluate different systems of medical care to establish whether these can reduce the incidence and severity of these complications and improve the standard of care for elderly patients with hip fracture.\n\n We thank N Badhe, N D Downing, D M Hahn, M Hatton, B J Holdsworth, C J Howell, J B Hunter, P J James, A R J Manktelow, J A Oni, P J Radford, B E Scammell, E P Szypryt, and A M Taylor for allowing their patients to be included in this study.

This article considers this hypothesis.\n\n The most common complication of EVAR is an endoleak which is the persistence of perigraft blood flow inside the AAA sac [10] [11] [12] [13] . Endoleaks are associated with adverse outcomes, including AAA sac growth, the need for conversion to open repair, high reintervention rates and rupture [10] [11] [12] [13] . Therefore, following EVAR long-term (possibly lifelong) imaging surveillance is recommended [10] [11] [12] [13] .\n\n Several imaging techniques for the surveillance of patients following EVAR have been described including plain radiography, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT)/CT angiography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging/MR angiography [13, 14] . Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages [13, 14] . Despite the availability of advanced imaging modalities some endoleaks may still be missed. Poor compliance with the follow-up schedule may be a reason but in some cases, the endoleak is missed due to technical deficiencies/shortcomings [12, [15] [16] [17] [18] .\n\n A recent report systematically reviewing the pathogenesis, etiology and timing of AAA rupture following EVAR identified a total of 270 patients with AAA rupture after EVAR [12] . The cause of AAA rupture was known for 235 patients. Endoleaks were the main cause of rupture in 160 of the 235 patients (type IA: 57 patients; type IB: 31 patients; type II: 23 patients; type III: 26 patients; type IV: 0 patients; endotension: 9 patients). The endoleak type was not specified in 14 cases with rupture due to endoleak [12] .\n\n The presence of an endoleak at the last follow-up before rupture was described for only 56 of the 160 patients in whom the main cause of rupture was an endoleak [12] . A description of the course of AAA sac diameter during follow-up was presented in 101 patients. Enlargement of the AAA sac during follow-up occurred in 36 of these patients, no change was seen in 39 and shrinkage was reported in 26 patients. In 35 patients no abnormalities were found during follow-up (absence of endoleak, wire fractures, migration, graft angulation, insecure fixation, signs of inflammation and sac enlargement). In another 6 patients only a small type II endoleak was found during follow-up while the AAA sac was stable or shrunken. So, in 41 patients no abnormalities were found during follow-up that required re-intervention [12] .\n\n Another study evaluated the incidence and impact of previously unrecognized type II endoleaks using a modified intraoperative angiographic protocol (namely the use of digital subtraction fluoroscopy continuously for 60 sec after injections of 20 ml iodinated contrast both in the pararenal aorta and within the endovascular graft) [16] . A total of 391 patients undergoing EVAR were evaluated (standard completion angiograms: 264 patients; modified angiographic protocol: 127 patients).", "passage_position": "0", "year": 2010.0, "venue": "The Open Cardiovascular Medicine Journal", "specialty": "Vascular Surgery"}, {"qa_id": "38_2878809_1_1", "paper_id": "2878809", "question": "What are the limitations of ultrasonography in detecting endoleaks following EVAR?\n", "answer": "Ultrasonography is a cost-effective and reproducible method for detecting endoleaks following EVAR.

A third study aimed to analyze the clinical implications of endoleaks documented by CT angiography which were missed by color duplex ultrasound in 232 patients undergoing EVAR during a 5-year period [17] . All patients were followed by both CT angiography and color duplex ultrasound at 1 month following the procedure and every 6 months thereafter.

Ultrasonography is a costeffective and reproducible method that identifies an endoleak in the majority of the cases; nevertheless, it may miss as many as 28% of endoleaks [17] . Due to its costeffectiveness, ultrasonography should remain the primary diagnostic tool for detecting endoleaks following EVAR. When a follow-up ultrasound examination is negative, however, FDG uptake could represent an investigation which could alert the physician about the presence of an endoleak following EVAR. However, since most ultrasound examinations will be negative, the cost of an additional investigation by FDG uptake is prohibitive unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion of an endoleak. Moreover, the FDG uptake will not accurately reveal the location of the endoleak and AAA infection could lead to increased FDG uptake (due to local inflammation) and result in misinterpretation [19] . As FDG represents an inflammatory state [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , it would be interesting to explore the role of drugs possessing antiinflammatory action. Through inhibition/decrease of AAA expansion rates, statins may play a role in the management of AAAs [20] . Oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of AAAs; thus statins may exert their growth inhibitory effect by interfering with this pathway [21] .

By this method, the living tissue was displayed red, and the infarcted tissue remained a pale tan color.

To elucidate the mechanism of angiogenesis, VEGF protein levels were evaluated (Figure 3) .The protein levels of VEGF in PRIT subgroups were elevated significantly compared with those in the control MI subgroups (p<0.05), and VEGF protein levels in PRIT subgroups increased with the training time prolonging (p<0.05). In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference between the control MI subgroups, indicating that PRIT could promote the regeneration of vessels. \n\n Capillary density was measured by endothelial cells stained with CD31 ( Figure 4 ). Quantitative analysis showed that induction of PRIT significantly promoted cardiac capillary density compared with that in the control MI subgroups (p<0.05) (Table 2, Figure 4 ), but there was no statistically significant difference between the control MI subgroups.

[19] . IPC refers to a prior brief period of ischemia/ reperfusion in the myocardium that may delay cell death after coronary occlusion. Unlike IPC, PRIT has a more remote effect by facilitating coronary collateral formation of the myocardium by repeated short-term skeletal muscle ischemia. The cardioprotective effect of short-term skeletal muscle ischemia has been previously evaluated in experimental [20] and clinical [21] studies and the beneficial effect on the ventricular myocardium is not specific for a particular species [8] .

This procedure can simulate the pathologic status of MI [23] . Our preliminary experiment showed that the suitable intensity of training was very important, and that highintensity training could stiffen the limbs of the rats, or even disable the walking ability of the animals. A appropriate training protocol as suggested by previous study [24] should be proceeded by applying a bilateral external tourniquet around the upper hind limb joint for 5 min, followed by 5 min reperfusion for a total of 6 cycles, once a day and five days a week, so as to achieve a beneficial cardioprotective effect without damaging the function of skeletal muscles. To judge the degree of MI, different test methods were used to evaluate cardiac changes of the heart comprehensively. Infarct sizes in PRIT subgroups were significant smaller than those in the control MI subgroups, and this post-MI reduction in infarct size was time dependent (Figure 4) . Sudden occlusion of a major coronary artery can result in AMI and rapid apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, leading to progressive fibrous replacement in the myocardium and LV dilatation [3, 25] . Previous studies [26] [27] [28] demonstrated that physiologic RIT could promote coronary collateral formation in the ischemic myocardium. Results of capillary density and VEGF protein level in this study also demonstrated it. However, the exact mechanism underlying physiologic RIT in promoting coronary collateral formation in the pathologically ischemic myocardium remains unclearly understood. Coronary collateral formation is reported to be mediated by the release of several growth factors, of which VEGF is the most important [23] . It was found in this study that high expression of VEGF was closely related to coronary collateral formation, and that the level of VEGF protein expression in the myocardium was up regulated in the PRIT subgroups compared with the control MI subgroups, and this phenomenon was more obvious when the training time was prolonged (Figure 3 ). And the capillary density was also consistent with the result of Western blotting analysis on VEGF protein level. Capillary densities in this study were promoted with the training time prolonging in the RIT subgroups, indicating that physiologic RIT could promote coronary collateral formation in the myocardium, thereby offering a cardioprotective effect, and this effect was more pronounced in the 6wRIT subgroup.\n\n There are some limitations in this study. First, the number of rats in each group was not large enough. And the additional factors could influence the reliability of the results such as failure of operation, disease and malignant arrhythmia after operations. In addition, the training time designed in the study was limited, and therefore we were unable to know whether there would be any change in the result beyond six weeks. Secondly, we failed to set a blank control group. Further studies with larger sample capacities and longer training time are needed to confirm the results of the present study.\n\n In conclusion, Remote ischemic training of skeletal muscles could induce a protective effect against myocardial infarction, and this protective effect may become better with the training time prolonging.", "passage_position": "3", "year": 2017.0, "venue": "International Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_13463090_0_1", "paper_id": "13463090", "question": "What are the typical cardiovascular anomalies associated with polysplenia syndrome?\n", "answer": "The typical cardiovascular anomalies associated with polysplenia syndrome include atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), partial anomalous pulmonary venous return, transposition of the great arteries, right-sided aortic arch, pulmonary valvular stenosis, and subaortic stenosis.

Right isomerism is suggested by the presence of complete atrioventricular septal defect, juxtaposition of the IVC and descending aorta, and viscerocardiac heterotaxy.

Although these previous studies may in part provide information as to the nature of sinus tachycardia, they reveal little which could explain the increased susceptibility of the heart to atrial fibrillation.\n\n We have reexamined certain electrophysiologic variables of atrial tissue and compared the electrophysiologic properties of the atria in euthyroid and experimentally induced hyperthyroid rabbits.\n\n Adult male white rabbits weighing 1.82 to 2.60 kg were randomly assigned to a control or thyroid-treated group. In the latter, hyperthyroidism was induced by a daily subcutaneous injection of 250 fig/kg Z-thyroxine for 7 days. The injection was prepared by dissolving sodium lthyroxine (Sigma Chemical Company) in a solution made alkaline by 0.1M NaOH and adjusted to a pH of 8.0 by adding 0.1M HC1. The control group received an equivalent volume of saline subcutaneously. Animal care and feeding were identical in the two groups.\n\n The thyroid state was evaluated in vivo by 576 ARNSDORF, CHILDERS protein bound iodine, weight loss, and heart rate. Before the rabbits were killed, they were placed in a dark box until heart rate was stable, and the rate was then recorded by surface electrocardiography.\n\n The rabbit hearts were perfused by the method of Langendorff with a standard Tyrode solution (NaCl 137 mM; KC1 4.0 MM; CaCl 2 1.8 mM; MgCU 1.05 mM; glucose 2 g/liter; and buffered with Na 16 mM, HCO 8 12.5 mM, H 2 PO 4 2.4 MM) . The temperature of the perfusate was maintained at 35.5\u00b0 + 0.2\u00b0 C by a thermostatically controlled water bath. A stopcock permitted the change of solutions without altering the temperatures of the perfusate. Bipolar steel, platinum, or Ag-AgCl electrodes were attached to the right and left atrial appendages for recording and stimulating.\n\n Electrophysiological Studies-Driving (Sj) and test stimuli (S 2 ) originated from independent constant-current generators. The basic driving stimulus was a square wave with a pulse width of 6 msec delivered with a current strength of twice threshold. The test stimulus was a square wave of 6 msec duration delivered through a separate but closely located bipolar electrode. Current strength was measured by the voltage drop method on a Tektronix RM 564 oscilloscope with a type 3A3 dual trace differential amplifier. A stimulus programmer, accurate to 1/23,000 msec, 1 triggered the timed driving and test stimuli. Electrograms were recorded either on the Tektronix storage oscilloscope by means of a Polaroid camera, or on a Grass Polygraph.\n\n Threshold was determined by delivering, after 16 driving pulses (S x ), a late diastolic test pulse (S 2 ) and was defined as the minimum current in milliamperes required to produce a response to each test stimulus. At a given basic driving frequency, strength -interval curves were determined by measuring the threshold requirements of S 2 when the Sx-S 2 interval was progressively shortened. The effective refractory period at a given basic driving frequency was defined as the minimum Sx-S 2 interval which permitted a successful response when the amplitude of S 2 was one and a half times threshold.", "passage_position": "0", "year": 1970.0, "venue": "Circulation research", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_26699166_2_1", "paper_id": "26699166", "question": "What are the effects of thyroxine treatment on the rabbit atrium?\n", "answer": "Thyroxine treatment in rabbits induces sinus tachycardia, a shift to the left of the strength-interval curves, a shortening of the effective refractory period, a lowering of the atrial multiple-response threshold, and a probable decrease of the threshold in late diastole.

Atropine had no consistent or predictable effect on these results.\n\n Threshold determined by a test pulse delivered late in the basic driven cardiac cycle showed a mean value of 0.17 ma (0.11-0.28 ma) in ten control rabbits and 0.12 ma (0.06-0.19 ma) in eight thyroid-treated rabbits.

Studies have shown that thyrotoxic hearts exhibit a shortened refractory period and an increased tendency to develop atrial fibrillation. This effect is not uniform and is believed to be due to electrical inhomogeneity in the atrial tissue, which creates conditions ideal for reentrant excitation and the initiation of atrial fibrillation. While the exact mechanisms underlying this increased susceptibility are not fully understood, it is clear that both the direct action of thyroxine on atrial muscle and the influence of the autonomic nervous system play a role. The autonomic nervous system can further modulate the clinical picture of thyrotoxicosis, with sudden increases in vagal effect potentially triggering atrial fibrillation in an already \"primed\" atrial myocardium.", "paper_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:26699166", "paper_title": "Atrial Electrophysiology in Experimental Hyperthyroidism in Rabbits", "passage_text": "have shown that this effect is not uniform in its distribution and suggest that the resulting electrical inhomogeneity makes conditions ideal for reentrant excitation and atrial fibrillation (17) .\n\n Leveque observed an increased susceptibility to atrial fibrillation in thyroid-treated dogs infused with acetylcholine; 81% had atrial fibrillation compared to 313? of the controls (18) . Hoffman et al., however, stated that the thyrotoxic heart is less sensitive than normal to vagal stimulation (19) .\n\n The shortening of the refractory period and increased tendency to atrial fibrillation demonstrated in the thyroid-treated hearts of our study are certainly reminiscent of the typical changes induced by vagal stimulation or by the administration of acetylcholine. However, in our experiments these effects remained long after the heart had been excised (hence denervated), isolated, and perfused. Most importantly, they were not significantly influenced by atropine.\n\n The tachycardia of the thyroid-treated preparations in our study has been noted by other investigators (20) . It can be presumed that such preparations, particularly after 30 minutes have elapsed, are under greatly diminished autonomic influence. In similar vein, Markowitz and Yater as early as 1932 demonstrated that thyroid hormone increased the heart rate in 2-day-old chick embryos, an age before neutral elements develop (21) . The independence of these rate changes of the autonomic nervous system has been demonstrated clinically, using propranolol. The latter either does not significantly alter the resting heart rate in thyroid-treated normal humans (22) , or reduces the rate comparably in patients with and without hyperthyroidism (23) .\n\n Although the changes in atrial electrophysiology noted in this study are attributed to a direct action of thyroxine, it is clear that the clinical picture of thyrotoxicosis can be additionally affected by the autonomic nervous system. For example, the actual initiation of fibrillation could occur during a sudden increase in vagal effect acting on an already \"primed\" atrial myocardium.\n\n Since the cellular electrical properties of spontaneous rate and refractoriness are mediated by the cell membrane, the action of thyroxine on atrial muscle must involve the membrane directly or indirectly. Acetylcholine produces changes secondary to an increase in the potassium permeability of the membrane. In the present experiments, an acetylcholine effect is presumably ruled out by unresponsiveness of our preparation to atropine. The induction of a similar change in potassium permeability by thyroxine seems unlikely, in view of its reduction of end-diastolic threshold. Acceleration of repolarization can also be induced by any membrane change that increases outward membrane current during the action potential, such as more rapid inactivation of inward sodium current. There is no reason to deny that thyroxine has a direct influence on active or passive ionic transport across cardiac cellular membranes. Thyroid hormone has been found to affect ionic movement in several tissues. In a series of papers, Matty and Green found that active transport of sodium in the toad bladder was inhibited by thyroid hormone (24) (25) (26) . Timiras and Woodbury noted decreased extracellular and increased intracellular sodium in the brain of thyroxine-treated rats (27) . Liu and Overman found an accumulation of sodium and calcium within skeletal muscle cells of thyroxine-treated rats and concluded that active transport was inhibited (28) . The interrelationship between sodium pump activity, or indeed any metabolic activity, and membrane events in excitable tissue needs to be better understood before this mode of action of thyroxine can be evaluated.", "passage_position": "3", "year": 1970.0, "venue": "Circulation research", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_23510187_0_1", "paper_id": "23510187", "question": "What are the common symptoms and manifestations of atrial myxoma?\n", "answer": "Atrial myxoma can present with a symptomatic triad, which includes mitral valve obstruction symptoms (such as cardiac insufficiency and weakness), embolism symptoms (especially affecting the brain and peripheral vessels), and systemic symptoms (such as fever and weight loss).

Consequently, the use of a minimally invasive approach through an upper mini-sternotomy for isolated aortic valve surgery or combined aortic root and ascending aorta surgery is finding wide consensus and spreading further among cardiac surgery centers worldwide [1] [2] [3] [4] . However, ascending aorta surgery with or without combined aortic arch surgery, especially total arch surgery, is not yet widely performed through a minimally invasive surgical incision. A full median sternotomy remains the standard approach for complex aortic surgery to ensure adequate exposure and safety [5] . However, some experts attempt to perform minimally invasive procedures in aortic arch surgery [6, 7] . The present study was performed to demonstrate that complex aortic surgery including total arch surgery and aortic root repair via a partial upper sternotomy is viable, safe, and equivalent to the standard procedure in terms of both safety and the risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events.\n\n \n\n From September 2010 to May 2018, 80 open heart operative replacements of the thoracic aorta for treatment of aortic dissection were performed by one surgeon in Chinese PLA General Hospital. Patients with isolated non-dissected aortic aneurysms were excluded. Among the 80 patients, 21 underwent operations through an upper mini-sternotomy and 59 underwent operations through a full sternotomy. Considering that the complexity of the clinical data may impact the results, we used standard propensity score matching to create a highly comparable control group. Thus, 18 patients in each group (upper mini-sternotomy group and median sternotomy group) were matched for the statistical analysis. In the upper mini-sternotomy group, 12 of 18 patients underwent emergency ascending aorta replacement combined with hemi-arch or total arch replacement and/or aortic root repair; 13 of 18 patients underwent concomitant total arch replacement, 3 underwent hemi-arch replacement, and 2 underwent ascending aorta replacement only; 9 of 18 patients underwent concomitant aortic root repair, 4 underwent valvesparing aortic root replacement (David procedure using re-implantation technique), 1 underwent Florida sleeve root repair, 4 underwent isolated aortic valvuloplasty, and 1 underwent wrapping of the aortic root with an artificial vascular prosthesis. In the matched group, 14 of 18 patients underwent emergency surgery for the ascending aorta combined with hemi-arch or total arch and/or aortic root replacement; 11 of 18 patients underwent concomitant total arch replacement, 6 of 18 underwent hemi-arch replacement, and 10 underwent concomitant aortic root repair (Bentall procedure in 4, aortic valvuloplasty in 5, and valvuloplasty with coronary artery ostia grafting in 1). The indication for aortic repair was based on the standard guidelines and was at the discretion of the multidisciplinary team. The baseline characteristics of the patients of each group are shown in Table 1 . Overall, the individual preoperative risk factors, including the EuroSCORE, were similar between the two groups.\n\n Our upper mini-sternotomy approach is similar to those described in previous reports. The patient was maintained in the supine position, and a single-lumen endotracheal tube was used for ventilation. The internal jugular vein was catheterized to monitor the central venous pressure and pulmonary artery pressure and provide an infusion pathway. A urethral catheter was routinely placed. After placing the patient under general anesthesia, we performed a 6-to 8-cm median skin incision and upper inverted-T mini-sternotomy to the level of the third or fourth intercostal space depending on preoperative computed tomography scan. A conventional sternal retractor was used to spread the sternum and expose the substernal tissue ( Fig. 1a ). The innominate vein and three branches of the aortic arch were then dissected separately. Once the pericardium was opened, the ascending aorta was exposed along its entire length. The strategy of cardiopulmonary circulation setup depended on the aortic anatomy and lesion characteristics. We generally selected cannulation of the innominate artery or axillary artery for perfusion and the right atrium for drainage. The left heart venting was inserted through the upper right pulmonary vein ( Fig. 1b ). Myocardial protection was routinely implemented by anterograde infusion of cold custodial Histidine-tryptophanketoglutarate (HTK, Bretschneider's solution, Custodiol) cardioplegic solution directly through the coronary ostia.", "passage_position": "0", "year": 2020.0, "venue": "Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_214809973_1_3", "paper_id": "214809973", "question": "What are the advantages of upper ministernotomy in aortic surgery?\n", "answer": "Upper ministernotomy is a minimally invasive technique used in aortic surgery.

These advantages include reduced postoperative morbidities such as lower blood transfusion volume, decreased postoperative drainage volume, shorter ventilation time, shorter ICU stay, and shorter hospital stay. Upper ministernotomy also has a lower rate of subxiphoid drainage for late cardiac tamponade.

Surgery of complex aortic lesions with or without concomitant aortic valve and root surgery was performed as necessary. Lower-body circulatory arrest was used in some patients who required total arch replacement and elephant trunk implantation. We preferred an \"arch-first\" strategy for arch replacement surgery. In these cases, we first accomplished reconstruction of the branches of the aortic arch [left subclavian artery (LSCA), left carotid artery (LCA), and innominate artery (IA)] using a four-branched graft with or without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to recover complete cerebral blood perfusion. When the bladder temperature had cooled to about 25\u00b0C, the lower body circulation was arrested and upper body (including cerebral) was perfused via the preferentially reconstructed supra-aortic branches, which we named it as \"complete antegrade cerebral perfusion\". We then performed frozen elephant trunk implantation in the descending aorta and arch reconstruction if necessary. In the rewarming period, proximal surgery such as root or ascending aorta reconstruction was performed. Deairing was routinely performed before declamping the aorta. A ventricular pacing wire was placed before declamping to allow for better exposure of the right ventricular wall via the minimal surgical access. Two straight 26-Fr thoracic catheters were inserted through subcostal incisions and connected to a water seal multichamber thoracic drainage device. The sternum was reconstructed with three single steel wires and breadthwise suture placement in a figure-eight pattern. \n\n The intraoperative variables are listed in Table 2 . The CPB time was similar between the two groups (209 \u00b1 47 min vs 218 \u00b1 62 min, p = 0.595), but the aortic crossclamping time was longer in the upper mini-sternotomy group than that of full sternotomy group (160 \u00b1 38 vs. 135 \u00b1 36 min, p = 0.048) due to higher rate of valvesparing aortic root replacement and total arch repair. The hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) time was similar between the two groups(40 \u00b1 10 min vs 48 \u00b1 20 min, p = 0.139), indicating that no more time was spent on descending aorta reconstruction in the upper ministernotomy group than in the control group. The postoperative morbidities are listed in Table 3 . Of all 36 patients, only 1 died in the observation group, and no significant difference was found in comparison with the control group (p = 1.000). The red blood cell transfusion volume (4.6 \u00b1 3.3 vs. 6.7 \u00b1 5.7 units, p = 0.042), postoperative drainage volume (764 \u00b1 549 vs. 1255 \u00b1 745 ml, p = 0.034), ventilation time (22 vs. 45 min, p = 0.014), intensive care unit (ICU) stay (4.6 \u00b1 2.7 vs. 7.9 \u00b1 3.7 days, p = 0.005), and hospital stay (8.2 \u00b1 3.8 vs. 21.4 \u00b1 11.9 days, p = 0.001) were all significantly lower in the upper ministernotomy group. The rate of subxiphoid drainage for late cardiac tamponade was significantly higher in the observation group than control group (33.3% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.004). The rate of dialysis for new occurrence of renal failure, neurological complications, and re-exploration was similar between the two groups (p = 1.000).\n\n Surgery of the ascending aorta with or without combined procedures, such as total arch replacement and aortic root reconstruction, has been traditionally performed through a median full sternotomy because this procedure can provide good exposure for deep surgical operations, especially when descending aorta management or aortic root procedures are required. Surgeons have often considered that the performance of a distal anastomosis in a deep position is technically challenging and that approaching the aorta beyond the reflection point of the arch via a median sternotomy is generally difficult [6] . Nowadays, however, the development of minimally invasive techniques has allowed increasingly improved results of aortic surgery, not only for isolated heart valve disease but also for ascending aorta repair, the Bentall procedure, and hemi-arch replacement.", "passage_position": "1", "year": 2020.0, "venue": "Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery", "specialty": "Cardiothoracic Surgery"}, {"qa_id": "38_214809973_2_1", "paper_id": "214809973", "question": "What are the benefits of the minimally invasive approach for valvular surgery compared to full sternotomy?\n", "answer": "The minimally invasive approach for valvular surgery has been shown to improve postoperative outcomes by reducing surgical trauma, the need for ventilation, the ICU stay, and the need for blood transfusion.

Widespread consensus has been reached regarding the efficacy of upper J ministernotomy for the treatment of aortic disease [2, 9, 10] . The indication for surgery, initially restricted only to selected patients, is now extended to those undergoing more complex surgeries, including surgeries involving the aortic root and ascending aorta as well as redo operations. The mini-sternotomy approach has been shown to be beneficial for respiratory function recovery, earlier extubation, and a shorter ICU and hospital stay [11] . In 2007, Tabata et al. [1] compared 79 patients undergoing ministernotomy with a cohort of patients undergoing surgery through full sternotomy. Their study was remarkable with respect to the variety of different procedures completed using the mini-sternotomy approach. In 2001, Svensson et al. [12] evaluated 54 patients undergoing minimally invasive valve surgery; of these, 36 patients underwent ascending aorta replacement, of whom 18 underwent aortic arch repair through a mini-sternotomy. In 2017, Goebel et al. [13] reported the outcomes of 21 patients who underwent non-emergency total aortic arch surgery through an upper mini-sternotomy. These patients' results were equivalent to those of patients who underwent the standard procedure in terms of both safety and the risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events.\n\n In the present study, we attempted to perform surgery of the ascending aorta with or without complex procedures such as total arch replacement or aortic root repair for Stanford type A dissection via a single inverted-T upper mini-sternotomy, beginning in 2016. We also retrospectively compared the outcome of this surgery with that of the same surgery performed through a full sternotomy using a statistical propensity score-matching analysis. The early results of postoperative renal failure and cerebral complications showed no significant differences between the mini-sternotomy and full sternotomy groups, but the respiratory function recovery was faster in the mini-sternotomy group. The CPB time was not prolonged, confirming that upper mini-sternotomy can provide good exposure and allow for adequate manipulation despite the small incision. Moreover, as the surgeon was getting more familiar with this mini access surgery, CPB time has been decreased and it was even shorter than that of full sternotomy group after off-pump reconstruction of LSCA was applied. The cross-clamping time was longer in the mini-sternotomy group than in the full sternotomy group. This might be explained by the fact that aortic root procedures in the upper mini-sternotomy group involved the David procedure using reimplantation technique (4 cases) and Florida sleeve aortic root repair (1 case), which may have taken more time than the Bentall procedure performed in the control group. The ICU and hospital stay were similar between the two groups, as reported in other papers, confirming that the ministernotomy approach has an advantage over full sternotomy with respect to recovery.\n\n The mini-sternotomy group showed a low incidence of re-exploration but a 39% higher rate of subxiphoid drainage for late pericardial tamponade. We believe that this was related to inadequate drainage in the early postoperative period because the position of the catheters may have been much higher than in full sternotomy, although we used the same drainage catheter and the same removal protocol in the two groups.\n\n We emphasize that preoperative imaging studies are essential to examine the morphological parameters of the total aortic pathology, especially the level of the aortic root, which can guide how far we do the transverse of sternum. Lentini et al. [14] considered that the diameter of the distal ascending aorta guides the need for circulatory arrest, which they believe argues against a minimally invasive approach. In our experience, however, deep HCA can be performed accessibly and safely (17 of 20 cases), allowing for total arch surgery or frozen elephant trunk implantation for descending aorta reconstruction via an upper mini-sternotomy. We believe that implementing an \"arch-first\" strategy and using artificial blood vessels with stents would allow easy and safe manipulation of the aortic arch through a small incision.", "passage_position": "2", "year": 2020.0, "venue": "Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_214809973_2_2", "paper_id": "214809973", "question": "What are some of the different minimally invasive approaches for cardiac surgery?\n", "answer": "Different minimally invasive approaches for cardiac surgery have been reported, including the upper J ministernotomy and the mini-sternotomy approach.

[12] evaluated 54 patients undergoing minimally invasive valve surgery; of these, 36 patients underwent ascending aorta replacement, of whom 18 underwent aortic arch repair through a mini-sternotomy. In 2017, Goebel et al. [13] reported the outcomes of 21 patients who underwent non-emergency total aortic arch surgery through an upper mini-sternotomy. These patients' results were equivalent to those of patients who underwent the standard procedure in terms of both safety and the risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events.\n\n In the present study, we attempted to perform surgery of the ascending aorta with or without complex procedures such as total arch replacement or aortic root repair for Stanford type A dissection via a single inverted-T upper mini-sternotomy, beginning in 2016. We also retrospectively compared the outcome of this surgery with that of the same surgery performed through a full sternotomy using a statistical propensity score-matching analysis. The early results of postoperative renal failure and cerebral complications showed no significant differences between the mini-sternotomy and full sternotomy groups, but the respiratory function recovery was faster in the mini-sternotomy group. The CPB time was not prolonged, confirming that upper mini-sternotomy can provide good exposure and allow for adequate manipulation despite the small incision. Moreover, as the surgeon was getting more familiar with this mini access surgery, CPB time has been decreased and it was even shorter than that of full sternotomy group after off-pump reconstruction of LSCA was applied. The cross-clamping time was longer in the mini-sternotomy group than in the full sternotomy group. This might be explained by the fact that aortic root procedures in the upper mini-sternotomy group involved the David procedure using reimplantation technique (4 cases) and Florida sleeve aortic root repair (1 case), which may have taken more time than the Bentall procedure performed in the control group. The ICU and hospital stay were similar between the two groups, as reported in other papers, confirming that the ministernotomy approach has an advantage over full sternotomy with respect to recovery.\n\n The mini-sternotomy group showed a low incidence of re-exploration but a 39% higher rate of subxiphoid drainage for late pericardial tamponade. We believe that this was related to inadequate drainage in the early postoperative period because the position of the catheters may have been much higher than in full sternotomy, although we used the same drainage catheter and the same removal protocol in the two groups.\n\n We emphasize that preoperative imaging studies are essential to examine the morphological parameters of the total aortic pathology, especially the level of the aortic root, which can guide how far we do the transverse of sternum. Lentini et al. [14] considered that the diameter of the distal ascending aorta guides the need for circulatory arrest, which they believe argues against a minimally invasive approach. In our experience, however, deep HCA can be performed accessibly and safely (17 of 20 cases), allowing for total arch surgery or frozen elephant trunk implantation for descending aorta reconstruction via an upper mini-sternotomy.

Crystalloids were restricted to 1 L to avoid pulmonary congestion. The surgical procedure was uneventful and a male infant of 2,290 g, Apgar score of 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, was delivered. Postoperative pain was managed with epidural morphine. After delivery, an increase in pulmonary artery pressure and ensuing dyspnea prompted the use of nitroglycerin, 0.05-0.5 g/kg/min and subsequently of nitric oxide up to 64 ppm through a facemask, obtaining no hemodynamic improvement. Oxygen supplementation increased SpO 2 (93 to 98%). Sildenafil and L-arginine were reinitiated at 150 mg/d and 6 g/d, respectively respectively, achieving within a few hours a significant clinical improvement and a decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance ( Figure 1B) . The patient was discharged 7 days postpartum on sildenafil 150 mg/d, L-arginine 6 g/d, and diltiazem 180 mg/d.\n\n At 85 days postpartum, the patient had a stable cardiac status (New York Heart Association class II) while taking sildenafil, L-arginine, diltiazem, and coumadin. Fourteen months later she remains in New York Heart Association class II.\n\n L-arginine, a semi-essential amino acid, is converted to nitric oxide by nitric oxide synthase. Nitric oxide activates guanilate cyclase to produce cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which promotes smooth muscle relaxation. However, sildenafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor of cGMP degradation, abundant in the corpum cavernossum and lung, promoting a greater availability of cGMP and hence smooth muscle relaxation.\n\n In nonpregnant patients sildenafil and L-arginine decrease pulmonary hypertension. 4, 5 When a single dose of sildenafil was combined with inhaled nitric oxide, the effects on cGMP and on pulmonary resistance were greater than when nitric oxide was administered alone, supporting a synergy of actions directed at different sites of the nitric oxide-cGMP pathway. 4 The use of sildenafil in pregnancy is restricted to a few reports, which evaluate the effect of short-term intravaginal administration in the success of in vitro fertilization, and describe no deleterious effects on mother and fetus.\n\n 7 L-arginine has been administered to preeclamptic patients and to mothers with intrauterine growth restriction, with good tolerance and beneficial effects on maternal blood pressures and uteroplacental blood flow. 8 It is plausible to associate the prepartum improvement in pulmonary artery resistance and fetal growth to a beneficial effect of this combination in the maternal and placental hemodynamics. The mild decrease in systolic pulmonary pressure, previously refractory to nitric oxide and nitroglycerin, as well as the significant reduction in the pulmonary artery resistance index, after the reinitiation of sildenafil and L-arginine, support this contention. However, it is not feasible to speculate whether the marked decrease in estimated pulmonary artery pressure observed at 12 weeks of gestation was due to a residual vasodilatation of the previous use of sildenafil, to the increment of diltiazem, or to the endogenous vasodilator surge of pregnancy.\n\n Epidural anesthesia, chosen to avoid airway instrumentation with its potential detrimental effects on pulmonary hemodynamics, caused no hypotension despite sildenafil and L-arginine given up to 16 hours previously.\n\n In summary, we present a case of severe cardiac compromise from Eisenmenger syndrome accompanied by preeclampsia, treated with sildefanil and L-arginine, by a coordinated team of obstetricians, cardiologists, and anesthetists in a tertiary clinical setting.

Although elevated blood pressure per se does not typically cause overt symptoms, the consequences of chronic hypertension, including cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, stroke, and kidney disease, are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality (2) . Treatments that effectively reduce blood pressure can prevent these complications (2) (3) (4) . However, in a recent analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) covering the period from 2009 to 2010, blood pressures were reduced to target levels in less than 50% of patients receiving hypertension treatment, and this rate was under 40% in individuals who also had chronic kidney disease (CKD) (5) . The reasons for these poor outcomes are complex and include health services issues around processes of care, compliance, and patient education. Moreover, the precise cause of hypertension is not apparent in the vast majority of patients with hypertension. Limitations in our understanding of hypertension pathogenesis in individual patients are an obstacle to applying individualized approaches for prevention and treatment and to identifying new, specific therapies.\n\n A connection between the kidney and blood pressure control The idea that the kidney plays a role in hypertension dates back almost 200 years. In the 19 th century, Richard Bright proposed that abnormalities in urine production by the kidney altered blood in such a way as to increase vascular resistance, leading to high blood pressure and increased cardiac mass (6) . A century later, Harry Goldblatt induced malignant hypertension in dogs by obstructing one of the renal arteries (7) . In the 1970's, Arthur Guyton and colleagues advanced a mature hypothesis suggesting that the kidney governs the level of blood pressure by regulating extracellular fluid volume. They argued that balance is normally achieved by matching urinary excretion of salt and water with dietary intake, thereby maintaining a constant extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure (8) . In this construct, when blood pressure increases from any cause, renal perfusion pressure increases with a consequent enhancement of sodium and water excretion, which Guyton called pressure-natriuresis. Based on the substantial capacity for the kidney to excrete sodium, this blood pressure-tempering mechanism should have sufficient gain to limit intravascular volume and thereby lower blood pressure in response to a range of stimuli from increased heart rate to elevated peripheral vascular resistance (9, 10) . Furthermore, the hypothesis predicts that a permissive modification of the pressure-natriuresis response is required to perpetuate a chronic elevation in intra-arterial pressure, whereby the equilibrium point for salt and water excretion is shifted to a higher level of arterial blood pressure (8) . While this hypothesis has been largely embraced by the nephrology community, it remains controversial in some circles based on work suggesting independent control of blood pressure by neural and vascular pathways, for example (11) (12) (13) . In addition, as discussed below, classic assumptions about direct associations between sodium retention and expansion of extracellular fluid volume have recently been questioned.\n\n Over the years, a series of kidney cross-transplantation studies have supported a key role for intrinsic functions of the kidney in the pathogenesis of hypertension (14) (15) (16) (17) . Generally, these studies have been performed using genetically compatible donor and recipient strains to circumvent rejection, with both native kidneys removed such that the full extent of excretory function is provided by the transplanted kidney. For example, transplantation of a kidney from a Dahl hypertensive rat into a normotensive, saltresistant recipient causes hypertension in the recipient regardless of whether the transplant is performed before or after a high salt diet is introduced (14, 15) . By contrast, reciprocal transplantation of a kidney from a normotensive, salt-resistant animal into a Dahl salt-sensitive rat abrogates hypertension (14, 15) . Likewise, studies in spontaneously hypertensive rats and Milan hypertensive rats recapitulated these findings (16, 17) . The same principle seems to also hold true in humans where resistant hypertension can be alleviated after successful kidney transplantation (18) . Collectively, these studies indicate that a defect in sodium excretion by the kidney confers susceptibility to elevated blood pressure.\n\n angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers effectively lowers blood pressure in a substantial proportion of patients with hypertension (19) , reflecting the important role for RAS activation as a cause of human hypertension. Similarly, in rodent models, deletion of RAS genes lowers blood pressure whereas overexpression causes hypertension (20) .\n\n A role for the actions of angiotensin II in the kidney to influence blood pressure is well established.", "passage_position": "0", "year": 2014.0, "venue": "The Journal of clinical investigation", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_70893801_4_1", "paper_id": "70893801", "question": "How does positive pressure respiration affect the size of the heart?\n", "answer": "Positive pressure respiration, specifically when applied by intermittent inflation of the lungs, can cause a slight decrease in the size of the heart.

The lung was expanded by a pressure of 8 to 10 cm. of water, the trachea being connected to a basal metabolism apparatus in which a positive pressure blower was used. The rabbit breathed 100 per cent oxygen in this experiment, although in the majority air only was employed. Expiration was allowed to take place passively. One minute after the injection, the transverse diameter of the heart increased from 3.3 cm. to 4.1 cm. After three minutes of positive pressure breathing, the heart size was slightly smaller, 3.9 cm. in transverse diameter. The animal was killed five minutes later. Considerable passive pulmonary congestion was found but no evidence of edema. Figure 3 shows the effect of intermittent inflation of the lung superimposed on a continuously exerted positive pressure both during inspiration and expiration. The animal's trachea was connected with a motor blower unit which maintained a positive pressure of 4 cm. during inspiration and 6 cm. during expiration. Intermittent inflation was then added so that the animal experienced a pressure of 10 cm. during inspiration and 6 cm. during expiration. The first photograph shows the normal transverse diameter of the heart to be 3.4 cm. One minute after injection of adrenalin there is an increase to 4.0 cm. The combined intermittent inflation and continuous positive pressure was begun immediately after the second picture and the film taken three minutes later. This showed a marked decrease in the trans- verse diameter of the heart to 3.1 cm. It will also be observed that the lung was expanded, the diaphragm flattened, and the lung field showed an increased radiability. The animal died five minutes later possibly due to the maintenance of excessive pressure interfering with an adequate inlet of blood into the right heart. At autopsy, however, pulmonary congestion and edema were not found.\n\n The three pictures reproduced above illustrate the significant findings obtained by roentgen-ray of the heart. We may summarize these results as follows: Following the intravenous injection of 0.5 c.c. of adrenalin per kg. of body weight, there is a marked increase in the transverse diameter of the heart within 15 seconds. A further progressive increase takes place, reaching a maximum at approximately three minutes after injection. At this time a darkening of the lung shadow, particularly at the bases of the lung, takes place.\n\n When positive pressure is applied by intermittent inflation of the lungs, pulmonary edema may be prevented. When moderate pressures are used, the heart size appears to be slightly decreased. Under these circumstances autopsy shows a dilated right ventricle, passive pulmonary congestion of moderate extent, without edema. When more marked positive pressure is employed, such as is achieved by intermittent inflation of the lungs plus a positive pressure continuously exerted during expiration as well as inspiration, the heart size may become even smaller than it was during the control period. Under these circumstances pulmonary congestion and edema may be prevented. However, the animal may die, if excessive restriction of blood flow is maintained for a long period.\n\n W e have not attempted to determine in a precise way the optimal pressures required to control the onset of pulmonary congestion and edema, but have established the fact that pulmonary edema may be prevented by the application of positive pressure respiration of such a degree as to cause a slight diminution in the size of the heart. The possibility presents itself that cardiac dilatation may be controlled by the application of positive pressure respiration in which a decreased entrance of blood into the right heart is accomplished. The danger of an excessive curtailment of total blood flow must of course be kept in mind.\n\n Since it had been assumed that a pathologically elevated negative chest pressure was the important factor in the production of pulmonary edema 8 '\n\n it seemed desirable to make direct observations of the intrapleural pressure.\n\n In the accompanying graph, the intrapleural pressure of a rabbit before and after adrenalin is shown (graph 1). It will be seen that the intrapleural pressure ranged from approximately -1.6 to -4 . 4 cm. of water during the control period. After injection of adrenalin (1.2 minutes) the range was exceedingly small, namely about 0.3 cm., the average pressure being -2.4 cm. The respiratory rate increased from 55 to 175.

In the group exposed to 6 cm. positive pressure, observations were taken within 3 minutes after pressure was withdrawn. In two cases there was no change, but in three others there was a marked prolongation, averaging 17 seconds. Although lengthening of the circulation time did not occur in all instances, the change when it did take place was much more marked than in the control subjects in whom prolongation of the circulation time when breathing against 6 cm. positive pressure averaged only 3.6 seconds (table 4).\n\n The vital capacity showed no consistent changes in the group breathing under 8 cm. positive pressure. However, in the group breathing under 6 cm. positive pressure, approximately 5 minutes after conclusion of the test, there was a rise in six out of seven patients, averaging 216 ex. The fact that this rise in vital capacity did not occur in the group breathing under 8 cm. positive pressure may be accounted for perhaps by the greater fatigue induced in the latter group by a longer experiment. A possible explanation for the elevation in vital capacity is that some blood was forced out of the lungs into the left heart during the test, allowing greater lung space, although this must be presented only as a tentative hypothesis. We wish to present three charts showing the significant changes in typical experiments. In the chart below (chart 8) the effect of breathing against positive pressure is shown in a patient with congestive heart failure. It will be seen that the venous pressure declines during the control period from 205 to 182 mm., begins to rise after the application of 3 cm. positive pressure, shows a still more marked elevation at 6 cm. positive pressure, reaching 225 mm., and then falls abruptly when the pressure is removed. The circulation time rose from 43 seconds to 53 seconds.\n\n In a patient with asthma (chart 9) the venous pressure rose only slightly with 3 cm. positive pressure, from 30 to 40 mm., but rose to a height of 75 mm. when 6 cm. positive pressure was used, falling to 25 mm. when pressure was withdrawn. No significant changes took place in blood pressure or pulse or respiratory rate in any of these cases.\n\n The last chart represents a reaction in a patient with neurocirculatory asthenia (disordered action of the heart) to positive pressure respiration (chart 10). The patient, a young man of 22 years, came to the hospital complaining of breathlessness at rest, palpitation and continuous heart consciousness. He was extremely apprehensive. On examination, his heart showed no abnormalities, the electrocardiogram was normal and roentgenray of the heart revealed no enlargement. The test was performed with the patient in a helmet, a leak-tight closure being made at the neck. Oxygen was breathed throughout. The chart shows that when he was breathing against 2 cm. positive pressure, there was a distinct rise in venous pressure CHART 8. Effect of breathing against positive pressure in a patient with congestive heart failure.\n\n on two occasions, from 90 to 120 mm. When the pressure was raised to 5 cm., the venous pressure rose still further to 138 mm. and dropped abruptly to 90 when the pressure was removed. The circulation time increased from 18 seconds to 27 seconds while he was breathing under 5 cm. water pressure. This case is of considerable interest in that it portrays physiological changes in a patient whose circulatory symptoms are of nervous origin. In another patient who had anxiety neurosis but without symptoms referable to her heart, the same test showed no elevation of venous pressure when breathing against 2 cm. water pressure and no change in circulation time. It would seem likely, therefore, that the rise in venous pressure which occurs after breathing against positive pressure is an indication of an inability of the heart to compensate for an arbitrarily induced back pressure by an increased blood flow. In normal individuals a mechanism exists whereby the circulation time is only slightly affected by resistance to the flow of blood into the heart, whereas in patients with heart disease, especially congestive failure, marked retardation of the velocity of blood flow may take place.\n\n An explanation of the relatively marked increase in venous pressure and prolongation of circulation time in patients with congestive heart failure exposed to positive pressure respiration invites consideration of several influences. In the first place, the increase of positive pressure within the chest interposes an obvious difficulty to blood entering the right auricle. However, this physical difficulty would appear to be of similar magnitude, other factors being equal, in normal subjects who, however, show comparatively POSITIVE PRESSURE RESPIRATION 7 7 9 slight changes.", "passage_position": "9", "year": 1938.0, "venue": "Annals of Internal Medicine", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_70893801_10_1", "paper_id": "70893801", "question": "How does congestive heart failure affect intrapleural pressure in patients?\n", "answer": "Congestive heart failure can cause an increase in intrapleural pressure in patients, particularly during expiration.

The cardiac patient would therefore be less able to increase the negative pressure within the chest and so in part lessen the additional positive pressure imposed on the lung from without, whereas the normal individual by an increase in the velocity and depth of breathing could increase the negative pressure within the chest to a degree which would practically overcome the arbitrarily imposed external positive pressure. In this way an explanation is afforded of the relatively small increase in venous pressure and the relatively insignificant interference with the velocity of the circulation that normal individuals show. Some of the variability in our results in patients may also perhaps be explained in this way, since an individual who because of psychic influences was hyperventilating at the time the circulation test was being made might be temporarily developing an increase in the negative intrapleural pressure which would augment the blood flow. As pointed out in the historical section of this paper, it has been repeatedly shown that an increase in the negative pressure within the chest increases the blood flow both through the lungs and the peripheral circulation. An additional influence may be set forth, namely, that the presence of an increased positive pressure within the chest interferes with the diastolic filling of the ventricles and the auricles as well, and that this interference would be more apt to have an adverse influence in a diseased heart muscle than in a normal one. It also seems likely that the increased pressure within the lung may in the case of an insufficient right ventricle retard a complete emptying of that chamber of the heart, thus causing a further back pressure of blood into the systemic veins.\n\n We have not discussed up to the present whether this repression of blood into the systemic venous reservoir is an adverse or a beneficial influence. At first sight it might seem that such a slowing of the circulation time would but increase the congestion of the viscera and extremities and thereby accentuate the harmful effects of heart failure. We must consider, however, that this effect is accomplished by decreasing the volume of blood passing through the heart.

The positive pressure within the chest creates a greater interference with diastolic filling of the diseased heart, as compared to the normal.\n\n The marked prolongation of circulation time found in some cardiac patients is not necessarily looked upon as a harmful influence since the decreased volume of blood with which the heart works may be helpful in restoring its function, despite the fact that greater back pressure is present in the systemic veins. Tourniquets applied to the extremities similarly reduce the amount of blood entering the heart, a procedure which has been found of special value in treating edema of the lungs and \" cardiac asthma.\"\n\n The use of positive pressure respiration in 8 clinical cases of edema of the lungs is described. The effect of the procedure was in most instances a swift clearance of edema and a betterment of the state of circulation. The function of positive pressure in these cases, as in the experimental production of pulmonary edema, was to exert a direct opposing physical force on the external capillary wall tending to counteract the tendency to ooze serum and to decrease the inlet of blood into the right heart, in that way diminishing pulmonary congestion and permitting the heart to work on a smaller volume of blood. An attempt was made to discuss the importance of the factors which have been outlined in each individual case.\n\n Acute pulmonary edema has been studied from an experimental and clinical point of view. In cases of respiratory obstruction the pathologically elevated negative pressure within the chest exerts a suction action on the pulmonary capillaries resulting in a tendency to ooze serum through their walls. Expiration against a constricted bronchial passageway maintains a backward pressure against the pulmonary capillary wall, inhibiting the leakage of edema fluid. A sudden termination of obstructive dyspnea, through excessive doses of morphine or as a consequence of tracheotomy, may be followed by edema fluid in the tracheobronchial tree. Positive pressure respiration has been found clinically helpful in the treatment of pulmonary edema associated with respiratory obstruction.\n\n The pathogenesis of acute pulmonary edema arising as a complication of heart failure seems best explained by the original hypothesis of Welch: \" A disproportion between the working power of the left ventricle and of the right ventricle of such character that the resistance being the same the left heart is unable to expel in a unit of time the same quantity of blood as the right heart.\" Positive pressure decreases the amount of blood entering the right heart and in that way diminishes pulmonary congestion and facilitates the clearing of pulmonary edema. When the lungs are distended from without by positive pressure there are the additional effects (a) a lowering of the negative pressure within the chest during inspiration and (b) a direct opposing physical pressure on the pulmonary capillaries, especially during expiration.\n\n When pulmonary edema is due to irritation and inflammation, resulting in an increased permeability of the pulmonary capillary walls, positive pressure respiration is at times less effective in clearing the signs of edema.", "passage_position": "18", "year": 1938.0, "venue": "Annals of Internal Medicine", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_205530552_0_1", "paper_id": "205530552", "question": "What are the treatment options for patients with isolated proximal LAD lesions?\n", "answer": "The treatment options for patients with isolated proximal LAD lesions include minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) surgery with the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) as a bypass graft and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stents.", "paper_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:205530552", "paper_title": "Randomized Comparison of Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery Versus Sirolimus-Eluting Stenting in Isolated Proximal Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery Stenosis", "passage_text": "Bare-metal stenting is inferior to MIDCAB surgery in patients with isolated proximal LAD lesions due to a higher reintervention rate with similar results for mortality and reinfarction.

Whereas proximal stenosis location in the LAD was a predictor of restenosis in the bare-metal stenting era, this location now has no increased risk for restenosis in comparison with lesions at any other location (3, 20) . Late lumen loss was 0.2 mm in the current trial, which is similar to the rate observed in previous SES trials and might be a reason why SES are superior for the prevention of restenosis compared with paclitaxel-eluting stents, particularly in lesions with a high risk of restenosis (21) (22) (23) .\n\n After surgery the rate of repeat revascularization, in contrast to stenting, was 0 in the current trial and 2% to 10% in previous trials, which underlines the well-known patency of LIMA grafts (3) (4) (5) 8, 24) .\n\n Stent thrombosis is a potentially important limitation of DES. However, whereas restenosis usually has a relatively benign clinical outcome, stent thrombosis is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and a high mortality (25) . This persistent, potentially prothrombotic substrate necessitates prolonged dual antiplatelet medication for at least 12 months as recommended in the current trial (26) .\n\n New, more potent antiplatelets will partially overcome this problem; however, these have not been tested extensively (27) .\n\n The minimally invasive surgical approach has been developed to minimize surgical trauma by limiting the access to the heart and avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass. Despite the more challenging access, patency rates similar to conventional bypass grafting have been reported (3). However, this approach is associated with a small but consistent rate of perioperative complications (3, 12, 28) , like in conventional surgery. Perioperative complications occurred significantly more often after surgery and had substantial impact on hospital resources. However, these complications did not influence quality of life at 12-month follow-up and the overall rate of MACE.\n\n Perioperative infarction has been observed in 7.7% of patients in the MIDCAB group, which is slightly higher compared with previous trials (0% to 4%) (4), despite the use of a more conservative definition of myocardial infarction (15) . This is somewhat surprising, because all grafts proved to be patent, and this accounted for the high MACE rate in the surgery group. In contrast, the rates for mortality and target vessel revascularization were slightly lower compared with previous trials, which is attributed to the long-term patency rate of the LIMA (29, 30) .\n\n Another important aspect is patient preference. Many patients refused to participate because of preference for stenting, which is the only true minimally invasive approach. In addition, no patients were excluded from stenting due to angiographic reasons or any comorbidity, in contrast to surgery.\n\n MACE at 12-Month Follow-Up (in Descending Order of Severity) The lack of a more long-term follow-up might be a limitation of this study, because the benefits of either revascularization strategy might emerge beyond 1 year. However, previous randomized trials did not find relevant differences at long-term follow-up for hard end points in patients receiving bare-metal stents (5) . Furthermore, at a median follow-up of 42 months there were no differences in the current trial. Another caveat was that the results were obtained only at a single highly-experienced tertiary care center. Thus, the results might not be generalized.

In many cases, heart failure is related to hypertension and is often associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and remodeling.", "paper_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:205535465", "paper_title": "Differential Effects of Antihypertensive Treatment on Left Ventricular Diastolic Function", "passage_text": "Heart failure is a common consequence of hypertension (1) , and in many patients is related to impaired left ventricular (LV) systolic function. However, heart failure is also commonly associated with diastolic dysfunction and apparently preserved systolic function. This accounts for approximately one-third to one-half of heart failure cases (2, 3) , and most of these patients have a history of hypertension (1), often with LV hypertrophy and remodeling (4 -8) .\n\n While many studies have focused on the effectiveness of hypertension treatment in reducing cardiac hypertrophy, less is known about the impact of treatment on LV diastolic function (8, 9) . Previous studies addressing the impact of different antihypertensive agents on LV diastolic function have largely used conventional echocardiography assessing transmitral filling and isovolumic relaxation. These conventional assessments have limitations as measures of LV diastolic function are load dependent, which makes it difficult to separate alterations in loading conditions from intrinsic changes in LV diastolic function due to treatment. Second, the conventional parameters can undergo \"pseudonormalization,\" where the ratio of the early to atrial transmitral peak velocity (E/A ratio) paradoxically increases with progressive diastolic impairment. Tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE) offers improved assessment of diastolic function (10) . TDE measurements of myocardial velocities are significantly less load dependent than conventional echocardiographic measurements; these measurements do not show pseudonormalization and independently predict cardiovascular events and mortality (11) (12) (13) . Few studies to date have used TDE to assess diastolic function in relation to the effects of different antihypertensive agents.\n\n The ASCOT (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial) study was a large multicenter randomized clinical trial that compared the effects of a beta-blocker plus diuretic (atenolol and bendroflumethiazide-K) regimen with a calcium-antagonist plus angiotensin-converting enzyme (amlodipine and perindopril) regimen on nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (14) . The study showed the amlodipine-based regimen was superior to the atenolol-based regimen on all major cardiovascular end points and all-cause mortality. As part of this ASCOT substudy, extensive data on LV diastolic function were collected using both conventional echocardiography and TDE. This provides the ideal setting to determine the impact of different antihypertension treatment regimens on LV diastolic function. We hypothesized that the amlodipine-based regimen would have more favorable effects on LV diastolic function in this large group of well-controlled hypertensive subjects.\n\n Patients. The population, methods, and response rate for the ASCOT study are described in detail elsewhere (15) . In brief, the ASCOT study was a clinical trial of blood pressure (BP)-lowering regimens in 19,342 men and women, age 40 to 79 years, with hypertension.

All participants were randomly assigned to either atenolol \u03ee bendroflumethiazide-K (atenolol-based regimen) or amlodipine \u03ee perindopril (amlodipine-based regimen).

However, heart failure is also commonly associated with diastolic dysfunction and apparently preserved systolic function. This accounts for approximately one-third to one-half of heart failure cases (2, 3) , and most of these patients have a history of hypertension (1), often with LV hypertrophy and remodeling (4 -8) .\n\n While many studies have focused on the effectiveness of hypertension treatment in reducing cardiac hypertrophy, less is known about the impact of treatment on LV diastolic function (8, 9) . Previous studies addressing the impact of different antihypertensive agents on LV diastolic function have largely used conventional echocardiography assessing transmitral filling and isovolumic relaxation. These conventional assessments have limitations as measures of LV diastolic function are load dependent, which makes it difficult to separate alterations in loading conditions from intrinsic changes in LV diastolic function due to treatment. Second, the conventional parameters can undergo \"pseudonormalization,\" where the ratio of the early to atrial transmitral peak velocity (E/A ratio) paradoxically increases with progressive diastolic impairment. Tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE) offers improved assessment of diastolic function (10) . TDE measurements of myocardial velocities are significantly less load dependent than conventional echocardiographic measurements; these measurements do not show pseudonormalization and independently predict cardiovascular events and mortality (11) (12) (13) . Few studies to date have used TDE to assess diastolic function in relation to the effects of different antihypertensive agents.\n\n The ASCOT (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial) study was a large multicenter randomized clinical trial that compared the effects of a beta-blocker plus diuretic (atenolol and bendroflumethiazide-K) regimen with a calcium-antagonist plus angiotensin-converting enzyme (amlodipine and perindopril) regimen on nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (14) . The study showed the amlodipine-based regimen was superior to the atenolol-based regimen on all major cardiovascular end points and all-cause mortality. As part of this ASCOT substudy, extensive data on LV diastolic function were collected using both conventional echocardiography and TDE. This provides the ideal setting to determine the impact of different antihypertension treatment regimens on LV diastolic function. We hypothesized that the amlodipine-based regimen would have more favorable effects on LV diastolic function in this large group of well-controlled hypertensive subjects.\n\n Patients. The population, methods, and response rate for the ASCOT study are described in detail elsewhere (15) . In brief, the ASCOT study was a clinical trial of blood pressure (BP)-lowering regimens in 19,342 men and women, age 40 to 79 years, with hypertension. Patients eligible for inclusion had hypertension and \u05463 pre-specified cardiovascular risk factors. Risk factors included male sex, current smoking, age \u054655 years, microalbuminuria/proteinuria, type 2 diabetes mellitus, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), electrocardiographic abnormalities, a history of early coronary heart disease in a first-degree relative, ratio of plasma total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of \u05466, peripheral vascular disease, and a history of cerebrovascular events.

The LV measurements were performed using M-mode from the parasternal long-axis view according to the American Society of Echocardiography conventions (17) , and LV mass was calculated according to the formula:\n\n where IVSd \u03ed intraventricular septal thickness in diastole, LVIDd \u03ed left ventricular diameter in diastole, and PWTd \u03ed posterior wall thickness in diastole. This was then indexed for body surface area to give the left ventricular mass index (LVMI). Ejection fraction was calculated using the Teicholz formula from the parasternal long-axis view using M-mode, or if not technically possible, Simpson's rule was used. Transmitral Doppler was assessed using a 5-mm sample volume placed at the tips of the mitral leaflets in passive end-expiration. A standardized loop of 10 cardiac cycles was downloaded to computer for off-line analysis of the early filling phase (E-wave) and the late filling phase (A-wave).

Using minimal gain settings, a series of 10 cardiac cycles were recorded. These were then downloaded for off-line analysis, with measurements made of systolic velocity (S=-wave), early diastolic velocity (E=-wave), and late diastolic velocity (A=-wave) at each location, and these were averaged. Analysis was performed using the HDI Laboratory software (Philips, Surrey, United Kingdom) by a single researcher who was blinded to all patient details.

Ejection fraction did not differ between groups. The LVMI tended to be lower in patients treated with the amlodipinebased regimen, although this did not achieve statistical significance (p \u03ed 0.089). Treatment with the amlodipinebased regimen was associated with higher early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E=), lower plasma BNP, lower E/E=, a smaller atrial diameter, and a shorter E-wave deceleration time, whereas E/A ratio was higher in people randomly assigned to the atenolol-based regimen (Table 2) .\n\n After adjustment for age and sex, E= remained significantly lower in patients treated with the atenolol-based regimen compared to patients randomly allocated to the amlodipine-based regimen (p \u03fd 0.001 adjusted for age and sex) ( Antihypertensive Treatment and Diastolic Function highly significant (p \u03fd 0.001) after further adjustment for systolic BP and LVMI. Further adjustment for heart rate, a factor directly related to hypertension treatment, had no impact on difference in E= (p \u03fd 0.001). Differences in E/E= and E/A ratio remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, systolic BP, and LVMI (Table 3) . Further adjustment for heart rate attenuated the difference in E/E= and E/A between the treatment regimens (p \u03ed 0.703 and p \u03ed 0.139, respectively). Similar associations were observed for BNP comparing the treatment regimens (Table 3) . No significant differences in LVMI between treatment groups were observed in unadjusted or adjusted data (Table 3) .\n\n This is one of the first large randomized clinical trials to compare the effect of antihypertensive medications on LV diastolic function assessed using TDE. In the present study, after approximately 12 months of intensive therapy, patients treated with the amlodipine-based regimen had evidence of better LV diastolic function compared with patients treated with the atenolol-based regimen (i.e., higher E=, lower plasma BNP, lower E/E=, smaller atrial diameter, and shorter E-wave deceleration time).\n\n These effects were independent of other factors associated with diastolic dysfunction including the BPlowering effect of the drug and LVMI. Differences in E/E= between the 2 treatment regimens could be accounted for by differences in heart rate, but this did not explain the differences in E= or BNP. The difference in E/A ratio, a widely used indicator of diastolic function, was discordant with other more sensitive measures of diastolic function, in that unadjusted E/A was higher in the atenolol-based regimen. This difference was also accounted for by differences in heart rate. A previous study also observed an improvement in the E/A ratio after 48 weeks of treatment with atenolol, which was highly correlated with the reduction in heart rate (8). We, therefore, suggest that E/A ratio is not a particularly useful indicator of diastolic function when heart rate differs between treatments. Differences in diastolic function seen in this study could be a consequence of differences in mechanisms of action of the drugs: amlodipine, perindopril, and bendroflumethiazide reduce blood pressure principally by reducing peripheral resistance, whereas atenolol has negative cardiac inotropic and chronotropic effects (19) .\n\n Characteristics of the Population at Year 1 \n\n Among patients 65 years of age and more with evidence of diastolic dysfunction, approximately 15% will have heart failure within 5 years (20) . Effective treatment could potentially delay or reduce the number of people having LV diastolic dysfunction and later progression to heart failure. Previous research has suggested that antihypertensive medications vary in their ability to maintain or improve LV diastolic function and filling pressure (8, 21, 22) . In particular, many studies have focused on effectiveness of hypertension treatments on LV mass; however, because of serious limitations of the study designs and methodologies, conclusions from these studies have been viewed with great caution (23) . In general, studies have used small samples sizes (8,21,24 -26) and have been underpowered to detect a difference between therapies.

Comprehensive evaluation by clinical examination, ECG, transthoracic echocardiography including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) and biochemical profiles were performed.\n\n Results: Patients with schizophrenia were of similar age, but had higher body mass index (BMI), rates of smoking and hyperlipidaemia than controls. Patients with schizophrenia had received clozapine or nonclozapine antipsychotics for a mean duration of 6.8\u00b15.3 and 9.7\u00b16.1 years, respectively.

Moreover, LVEF was <50% in 9/100 (9%) patients receiving clozapine and in non-clozapine schizophrenia patients or healthy controls, but this was not statistically significantly different (analysis of covariance, p=0. 19) . Univariate analysis in patients taking clozapine found that impaired LV was not predicted by high-sensitivity troponin T, but was associated with features of the metabolic syndrome (including increased triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), high-sensitivity C reactive protein and BMI), elevated neutrophil count, elevated heart rate, smoking and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide. In patients taking clozapine, multivariable analysis identified elevated neutrophil count and low HDL-C as the only independent predictors of impaired GLS.\n\n Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic which is effective in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. It is particularly useful in patients who do not respond to conventional therapy or are intolerant of other agents. 1 It achieves greater reductions in suicidal behaviour compared with other antipsychotics in treatment-refractory schizophrenia. 2 A recent population study concluded that clozapine significantly lowers all-cause mortality relative to other antipsychotic medications. 3 Despite its efficacy, clozapine use can be associated with significant side effects. These include haematological consequences such as agranulocytosis, neutropenia and leucocytosis, 4 and cardiac side effects such as acute myocarditis, persistent tachycardia and cardiomyopathy. 5 Postmarketing experience suggests that\n\n \u25aa This is the first comprehensive study to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic myocardial dysfunction utilising echocardiography in patients with schizophrenia on long-term clozapine treatment. \u25aa Our study has shown asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (with impairment in Simpson's EF and global longitudinal strain) is more common than previously recognised in this patient group. \u25aa The degree of left ventricular dysfunction is independently associated with markers of inflammation including elevated neutrophil count and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C). \u25aa The study is cross-sectional in design without prospective data before the commencement of treatment for schizophrenia. \u25aa Future studies will need to determine if the asymptomatic changes in left ventricular function we have observed relate to long term outcome.\n\n leucocytosis and neutrophilia occur in up to 10% of patients receiving clozapine. 6 Although the incidence of clinically severe clozapine-induced cardiomyopathy is reported as 51.5 per 100 000 patient-years, 7 this is likely to be an underestimate, as cardiomyopathy can be mild. Moreover, the predictors of cardiomyopathy after longterm clozapine treatment are unclear. This is important, as guidelines advocating annual clozapine review and management of clozapine treatment based on cardiac findings have not been universally agreed on, and could be strengthened by improved understanding of the cardiac response to long-term antipsychotic use.\n\n Traditional evaluation of cardiac function has involved assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) or gated heart pool scan.

We also studied two control groups (with schizophrenia but not receiving clozapine and healthy controls). Our secondary aim was to investigate whether inflammation, tachycardia or other clinical or biochemical parameters might independently predict the extent of LV dysfunction in these patients.\n\n \n\n From January 2010 to December 2012, consecutive patients on long-term clozapine treatment were recruited from outpatient cardiac clinics established for the routine care of psychiatric patients at two separate hospitals (Concord Repatriation General Hospital and Canterbury Hospital).

We have identified mildly impaired cardiac function in patients with schizophrenia, which was more severe in patients taking clozapine, whether measured by conventional parameters of LVEF or by assessment of myocardial function by GLS. We also report for the first time that, in patients taking clozapine, the subclinical impairment of LV function is independently associated with systemic inflammation characterised by neutrophilia and with low HDL-C.\n\n Depending on the definition used to define subclinical cardiomyopathy, between 9% (LVEF<50%) and 49% (GLS>\u221216.6%, ie, below 2 SDs or the 95% CI of the normal controls) of patients on long-term clozapine treatment had at least some degree of LV systolic impairment. This may be a conservative estimate given that published normal values for LV GLS are reported to be \u221218.6\u00b10.1%.\n\n 18 Among non-clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia, 14% had impaired GLS based on the above definition. This subclinical LV dysfunction was global (no patients had evidence of segmental dysfunction as is seen after myocardial infarction), was asymptomatic and was not associated with an elevation of HsTropT or with ECG abnormality. There was no evidence of greater dysfunction in those patients having received clozapine for longer duration, suggesting this is not necessarily progressive over time.\n\n The precise mechanism of clozapine-induced muscle injury is not known; however, it is most likely that that the changes are due to direct toxicity of clozapine on the myocardium and not myocarditis as these patients were apparently well and no patient had clinical, ECG or biochemical history to suggest myocarditis. Clozapine is an antagonist of calmodulin, which regulates the contractile response of striated muscles via its effects on calcium uptake, DNA synthesis, neuromuscular transmission and various kinases. Myotoxicity and neurotoxicity have been reported in patients on long-term clozapine treatment based on electromyography, nerve conduction and muscle biopsy studies. 22 23 Raised serum CK levels, a marker of muscle damage, have been reported in 14-78% of patients on clozapine treatment, independent of dose. 22 23 In our study, 14 of the 100 patients in the clozapine group had raised CK, compared with 2 of 20 controls ( p=ns). Similar mechanistic pathways may contribute to clozapine-induced cardiomyopathy. The lack of significant association of NT-proBNP with GLS in multivariate analysis ( p=0.08) may be due to sample size. However, as our echo data found that impairment in LV contractility was a more striking abnormality than chamber dilation with subsequent NT-proBNP release, 24 the lack of dilation and myocardial stretch explain the relatively modest NT-proBNP release in our cohort.\n\n Our results suggest that the subclinical cardiac dysfunction we have observed with clozapine in this study is not rare and idiosyncratic, as is the incidence of acute myocarditis. Rather, this appears to be a common occurrence affecting a high proportion of patients receiving clozapine, and unlike myocarditis, is unrelated to levels of HsTropT. As some degree of subclinical cardiac impairment may be common in patients receiving clozapine, its detection may not necessarily warrant clozapine cessation.

Given the correlation we observed between neutrophilia and cardiac dysfunction, it is possible that the same metabolites promote myocardial dysfunction and neutrophilia. There were active smokers among the patients receiving clozapine, and smoking has been shown to be associated with increases in total and differential leucocyte counts. 29 However, smoking was not an independent predictor of impaired LV GLS on multivariate analysis in the current study and there was no interaction between smoking and neutrophilia in our modelling.\n\n Studies in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis have shown an inverse correlation between HDL-C levels and levels of several proinflammatory markers, with HDL-C having anti-inflammatory properties. 30 We found that patients on clozapine treatment had reduced HDL-C compared with patients in the non-clozapine group and healthy controls, and reduced HDL-C was an independent predictor of impaired LV contractility. This supports the possibility that a heightened inflammatory state explains the reduced HDL-C levels, and that the subclinical cardiomyopathy of patients with schizophrenia receiving clozapine may be inflammatory in origin. Whether low HDL-C provides unique prognostic or mechanistic information regarding clozapine-related myocardial dysfunction requires further study.\n\n Clozapine-related tachycardia occurs in approximately 25% of patients, with average heart rate increases 10- 15 bpm reported. 31 The mechanism of tachycardia appears to be due to the anticholinergic effects of clozapine, resulting in vagal inhibition. 32 Persistent tachycardia can result in tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. 33 In our study, although the mean resting heart rate was raised in patients receiving clozapine, it was nonetheless less than 100 bpm. In addition, the resting heart rate did not correlate with inflammatory markers such as neutrophil count or hsCRP. Further studies are required to determine the effects of heart rate reduction with pharmacological agents on changes in LV contractility among patients receiving clozapine treatment.\n\n In our study, although patients with schizophrenia receiving non-clozapine antipsychotic medications had less severe impairment in LV systolic function than did patients receiving clozapine, the degree of impairment remained significant when compared with healthy controls in terms of Simpson's EF ( p=0.03) and GLS ( p=0.009).", "passage_position": "5", "year": 2014.0, "venue": "Open Heart", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_6277900_6_1", "paper_id": "6277900", "question": "What are the potential cardiac complications associated with long-term use of clozapine and non-clozapine antipsychotic medications?\n", "answer": "Long-term use of clozapine and non-clozapine antipsychotic medications has been shown to result in significant weight gain and is associated with the development of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes.

Diabetes is an independent risk factor for the development of CVD and the presence of diabetes is a poor prognostic marker in those with CVD. The increasing prevalence of diabetes worldwide and the burden on global healthcare that this represents makes developing strategies to improve cardiovascular outcomes a public health priority.\n\n Most research on improving cardiovascular outcomes by addressing cardiovascular risk factors in diabetes relates to those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), characterised by insulin resistance with variable degrees of beta-cell dysfunction, and is typically associated with abnormal lipid profiles, obesity and other features of the metabolic syndrome. 1 In T2DM the abnormal lipid pattern consists of raised concentrations of triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) concentrations. Total levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) are similar to populations without diabetes, but with a greater proportion of small-dense particles which are more atherogenic. By contrast, in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) that is well controlled, triglyceride levels tend to be lower and HDL cholesterol concentrations are average or even high. 2 Observational studies have demonstrated a strong positive relationship between raised LDL cholesterol levels and increasing risk of cardiovascular events. 3 Lowering LDL cholesterol is thought to slow down the development and progression of atherosclerosis and decrease cardiovascular events. Statins have been in clinical use for 20 years and reduce LDL cholesterol by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG CoA) reductase and decreasing endogenous production of LDL cholesterol in the liver.\n\n This review revisits evidence from key randomised cardiovascular outcomes trials and meta-analyses on the cardiovascular benefits of statins in diabetes. In a future paper we will examine the results of newer studies with other lipid-lowering therapies in people with diabetes, including recent results on the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors in these patients.\n\n Studies in subjects with diabetes Two studies have examined statin use for the primary prevention of CVD exclusively in those with diabetes. The Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) involved 2,838 subjects aged 40-75 from centres around the UK and Ireland who were randomised to either 10 mg atorvastatin or placebo. 4 Participants had T2DM with no history of CVD, but had at least one other cardiovascular risk factor. The study was terminated 2 years early because the pre-specified stopping rule for efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events had been achieved. Subjects allocated to atorvastatin had a 37% significant reduction in the primary endpoint of acute coronary heart disease (CHD) events (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, acute CHD death, resuscitated cardiac arrest), coronary revascularisation or stroke. All-cause mortality was numerically lower in the atorvastatin group but was not statistically significantly reduced.\n\n The Atorvastatin Study for Prevention of CHD Endpoints in Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (ASPEN) study included 2,410 subjects with T2DM who were also assigned to receive 10 mg atorvastatin or placebo. This international study was originally intended to look at secondary prevention with a follow-up of 4 years; however, due to changing guidelines impairing recruitment, the protocol was changed and a primary prevention cohort were also recruited. 5 For the primary prevention cohort a significant 30% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels was observed, but no beneficial REVIEW effect was found on the primary outcome which was a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, recanalisation, coronary artery bypass surgery, resuscitated cardiac arrest and hospitalisation for unstable angina. Similar results were found in the small secondary prevention cohort. There are multiple limitations of this flawed study including the change in the study design, the multiple endpoints, the low risk of events in the primary prevention cohort and the extensive use of non-study lipidlowering therapy in both groups.\n\n Trials including large numbers of subjects with diabetes Several studies have investigated statin use for primary prevention with substantial subgroups of subjects with diabetes.

This 32 Studies that contributed to the metaanalysis comprised ALLHAT-LLT, ASCOT-LLA, CARDS, CARE, HPS, LIPID and 4S trials, which are described above, plus three other studies of primary prevention (AFCAPS/TexCAPS, PROSPER, WO-SCOPS), [33] [34] [35] three secondary prevention studies (GISSI-P, LIPS, Post-CABG) [36] [37] [38] and one study in subjects post renal transplantation (ALERT). 39 18,686 of the participants had diabetes, including 1,466 subjects with T1DM (2% of the total) and 17,220 with T2DM (19% of the total). 40 The results were strongly positive with a 9% reduction in all-cause mortality for every 1 mmol reduction in LDL cholesterol with statins. This was irrespective of whether vascular disease was present prior to study recruitment (secondary prevention) or there was no known vascular disease (primary prevention). The proportional effect was similar in patients with T1DM and T2DM. Back to back with the publication of the SEARCH trial, the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration produced a further metaanalysis of trials with at least 1,000 participants each with a follow-up duration of 2 years. 41 They identified the five trials described earlier (A to Z, IDEAL, PROVE IT, SEARCH, TNT) and 21 trials of statins versus control. The results of intensive statin treatment were overwhelmingly positive and showed that more intensive lipid lowering led to a 15% further reduction in major vascular events compared with standard lipid lowering. Between 11% and 24% of people had diabetes in these five trials and the significant impact upon cardiovascular events was seen in both T1DM and T2DM.", "passage_position": "3", "year": 2018.0, "venue": "British Journal of Diabetes", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_55326405_4_2", "paper_id": "55326405", "question": "How effective is statin therapy in reducing cardiovascular events in individuals with diabetes?\n", "answer": "Statin therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular events in individuals with diabetes.

The first looked at data from seven randomised controlled trials of primary prevention (AFCAPS/TexCAPS, ASPEN, ASCOT-LLA, CARDS, HPS, MEGA, PROSPER) including 12,711 patients with diabetes. 42 Statin therapy was associated with a significant 21% reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events. No significant difference was found in all-cause mortality between statin-treated and control groups although all-cause mortality was only reported in three studies so this may have been underpowered for this outcome.\n\n A further meta-analysis of 22 trials was conducted and found that statin therapy significantly reduced by 21% the incidence of CVD in subjects with diabetes. 43 Finally, a recent meta-analysis included five studies of statin versus placebo (ASPEN, CARE, LIPID, HPS, 4S) and four studies of high-dose versus low-dose statins (A to Z, PROVE IT, SEARCH, TNT) and concluded that, compared with placebo, statin treatment reduced major cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events by 15% in subjects with diabetes, with a further 9% reduction comparing high-dose with low-dose statins. 44 \n\n Statins are generally well tolerated and the risk of myopathy, myositis and rhabdomyolysis associated with statin use is rare. Statin therapy slightly increases the development of new diabetes, 45 and this is more marked with higher dose statins. 46 The metabolic side effects of statins in people with diabetes are a minor increase in HbA1c of 1.3 mmol/mol (0.12%), 47 but this is trivial compared with the overwhelming evidence of cardiovascular risk reduction. For primary prevention, most trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated a significant benefit of statin therapy in reducing cardiovascular events in those with diabetes. For secondary prevention, intensive lipid-lowering regimens with high-dose statins have an even greater benefit compared with standard lipid-lowering treatments in further reducing cardiovascular events, but higher doses may not be tolerated due to an increase in side effects.\n\n for advisory boards and/or lectures from MSD and Pfizer.

In 35 patients (83% [18 in the LDL apheresis group, 17 in the medication group]), comparative data from 12 the first study and subsequent follow-up were available. Paired data were missing in seven patients because of 1) insufficient image quality from one session in two patients and from both sessions in a third patient with chronic airway obstruction; 2) loss of stored digital images from one session in two patients; and 3) no comparable DSA in two patients.\n\n ROIs. In total, 121 comparative ROIs were available, 68 in the LDL apheresis group and 53 in the medication group (mean 3.5 \u00b1 1.7/patient).

Because of the method of assessment of HMTT (intracoronary papaverine and sublingual isosorbide dinitrate), it is unlikely that endothelium-dependent vasodilation is in volved in the improved regional myocardial perfusion observed in this study.\n\n 2, Remodeling of the conduit vessel w all Progression or regression of coronaiy arteiy stenosis may be associated with complex shape changes or remodeling (40) , in which the integrated hemodynamic effects on the coronary circulation may differ from the changes in minimal obstruction diameter and mean segment diameter. According to Glagov et al. (41) and Stiel et al. (42) , progression of coronary artery disease leads initially to compensatory dilation. In the setting of regression of atherosclerotic plaques, this process might be reversed, with remodeling of the vessel wall without a signifi cant effect on lumen cross-sectional area of the epicardial coronary arteries. However, the dilation of the remodeled coronary arteries in response to papaverine may be enhanced, and maximal myocardial perfusion may be increased. This view is supported by a recent publication (43) in which the epicar dial response to intracoronary nitroglycerin administration decreased significantly with increasing atherosclerotic wall thickening. Next to obstruction of the vascular lumen, athero sclerosis of the arterial wall also has an endotheliumindependent effect on coronary vasomotion and flow. Decrease in atherosclerotic thickening of the arterial wall without a direct effect on the lumen size of the vessel may explain the observation that functional improvement precedes anatomic regression of atherosclerosis.\n\n 3. Improved arteriolar vasodilation. Resistance vessels are spared from the development of overt atherosclerosis. How ever, relaxation of these vessels may be reduced in patients with high LDL cholesterol levels due to alterations in endo thelial cell function, as established in primates (23) . Endothelium-dependent arteriolar relaxation was impaired, whereas endothelium-independent responses were nearly identical (23) . In the human forearm model, the impairment of microvascular vasodilator function in patients with hypercho lesterolemia is endothelium-dependent only (25) ; thus, im provement in endothelium-independent arteriolar vasodilation as a mechanism for our results is highly speculative. Another hypothesis, introduced by Gould et al. (44) , is that the coronary flow response induced by direct effect of an arteriolar vasodi lator may be augmented by further improvement in flowmediated, endothelium-dependent epicardial coronary artery vasodilation. However, this effect was not likely to occur in this study, where patients received isosorbide dinitrate for epicar-diai coronary artery vasodilation before angiography. Maximal epicardial vasodilation after sublingual isosorbide dinitrate is known (45, 46) to persist for 30 to 60 min, which was the time needed in this study to perform angiography and DSA. 4 . Changes in blood rheology. Improved myocardial perfu sion might be due to changes in blood rheology as a result of repeated LDL apheresis (47, 48) . Because of this observation, assessment of HMTT in the present study was performed 1 month after final LDL apheresis to avoid a direct effect of LDL apheresis on viscosity. In LDL apheresis over dextran sulfate cellulose columns, plasma fibrinogen, a determinant of viscos ity, is lowered acutely by 26% to 35%, returning to pretreat ment levels between 2 and 7 days (11, 49) . Seven days after LDL apheresis plasma viscosity is unchanged, but blood vis cosity is still reduced, independent of the change in hematocrit (48) . Rigidity of red blood cells is increased in patients with high LDL cholesterol values, causing elevated blood viscosity. Low density lipoprotein apheresis improves the erythrocyte deformability, but how long this effect lasts after multiple procedures is unknown. In the study of Rubba et al. (48) , 3 weeks after the last of six procedures for LDL apheresis, peak blood flow in the leg was significantly increased, whereas that in the forearm was unchanged. During our study, there was a small decrease in hematocrit in the LDL apheresis group, but at cardiac catheterization the hematocrit levels were not significantly different within and between both groups.", "passage_position": "5", "year": 1996.0, "venue": "Journal of the American College of Cardiology", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_2928970_2_1", "paper_id": "2928970", "question": "What are the potential benefits of sitagliptin and metformin in the treatment of myocardial infarction?\n", "answer": "Sitagliptin and metformin are two medications that have been studied for their potential benefits in the treatment of myocardial infarction.

Taken together, these data show that the cardioprotective effects of genetic or pharmacological inhibition of DPP-4 activity are not strictly glucose dependent and depend on one or more DPP-4dependent actions in vivo.\n\n Analysis of the cardiovascular profile of antidiabetic agents involves ascertainment of the effects of each drug on the myocardium and endothelium, and on secondary risk factors such as control of blood pressure and cholesterol. Although preclinical studies may be useful in generating hypotheses about the putative cardiovascular actions of different drug classes, the results of subsequent clinical studies have not always been concordant with predictions made from preclinical analyses. For example, although both thiazolidinediones, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, exert beneficial effects on inflammation and endothelial function (29) , pioglitazone, but not rosiglitazone, is associated with reduced cardiovascular events in human studies (3, 30) . Similarly, although data from both preclinical (31) and clinical studies (32) suggests that metformin therapy may be cardioprotective, the mechanisms through which metformin therapy is associated with cardioprotec- \n\n \n\n tion remain poorly understood. Moreover, sulfonylureas have been associated with increased rates of death from cardiovascular disease in some (33) but not all studies (32) .\n\n We have now investigated the cardiovascular consequences arising from genetic elimination or pharmacological inhibition of DPP-4 activity. DPP-4 has three major functions; adenosine deaminase binding, peptidase activity, and extracellular matrix binding, all of which potentially influence the activity of the immune and/or endocrine systems (34) . Although DPP-4 cleaves and inactivates several cardioactive peptides, including neuropeptide Y, brain natriuretic peptide, SDF-1, and GLP-1, there is little information on the cardiovascular consequences of reduced or absent DPP-4 activity. Normoglycemic Dpp4 \u03ea/\u03ea mice exhibit normal cardiac structure and function in the basal state, yet increased survival after experimental MI. Whether the increased survival after LAD ligation is directly due to loss of DPP-4 activity per se in cardiomyocytes or blood vessels, or indirectly due to the subsequent upregulation of cardioprotective molecules such as GLP-1 (18) or SDF-1 (35) , cannot be inferred from the present study. Zaruba et al. (35) also observed modest improvements in survival after experimental MI in Dpp4 \u03ea/\u03ea mice or in WT mice treated with a DPP-4 inhibitor, and more robust improvements in survival were observed after administration of G-CSF, findings attributed to SDF-1-dependent mobilization of cardiac stem cells. Our studies extend their observations through examination of the cardiovascular effects of DPP-4 inhibition in diabetic mice and by demonstrating that direct sitagliptin administration into the circulation of the ischemic mouse heart is not directly cardioprotective ex vivo, suggesting that acute reduction of cardiac DPP-4 activity is not sufficient to produce cardioprotection.\n\n Our findings demonstrating that both sitagliptin and the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide upregulated levels of cardioprotective proteins in the nonischemic myocardium suggest a possible role for GLP-1 in the context of enhanced survival after DPP-4 inhibition and experimental MI. Nevertheless, we did not observe a sustained induction of cardioprotective proteins in sitagliptin-treated murine hearts when the same proteins were examined after MI. Moreover, we did not detect significant changes in infarct size or cardiac function after MI that might directly account for the improved survival seen with genetic or chemical reduction of DPP-4 activity. Hence, the precise mechanisms mediating the improvements in survival observed after pharmacological treatment with sitagliptin in diabetic mice or genetic reduction of DPP-4 activity in normoglycemic Dpp4 \u03ea/\u03ea mice require further investigation, ideally through examination of whether DPP-4 inhibitors exert cardioprotective actions in Glp1r \u03ea/\u03ea mice.\n\n Western blot analysis of proteins in nonischemic hearts demonstrated that both sitagliptin and metformin therapy induced an overlapping set of cardioprotective proteins. Metformin is thought to exert its cardioprotective actions through distinct mechanisms requiring activation of AMP kinase and endothelial nitric oxide (31) .", "passage_position": "5", "year": 2010.0, "venue": "Diabetes", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_2928970_6_2", "paper_id": "2928970", "question": "What is the relationship between hyperglycemia and outcomes after myocardial infarction (MI)?\n", "answer": "Hyperglycemia is a risk factor for a poor outcome after MI in humans.

Accordingly, the extent to which therapy with sitagliptin and metformin produces an overlapping spectrum of actions reflecting similarities in their mechanism(s) of action through enhanced levels of GLP-1 requires further clarification.\n\n Both metformin and sitagliptin significantly increased survival in diabetic mice, possibly due to a comparable reduction in blood glucose achieved with either agent. Hyperglycemia is a risk factor for a poor outcome after MI in humans (39) , and there is considerable interest in determining whether intensive glucose control safely and consistently improves outcomes post-MI (40) .

Similarly, our observations demonstrating that genetic or chemical inhibition of DPP-4 is associated with enhanced recovery of LVDP in the normoglycemic ischemic murine heart ex vivo suggest that DPP-4 modifies cardiovascular outcomes independent of glucoregulation and provide a useful model for future studies.

The Future of Academic Cardiovascular Medicine", "passage_text": "But at this moment, we need many more cardiologists because the mortality and prevalence of CVD are continuing to increase sharply and will continue to do so for the next 10 to 15 years.\n\n What is happening with research funding in this country? Where once we only saw opportunities, today we face major challenges: the number of applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) between 1993 and 2003, in terms of new grants and grant renewals, has been flat even though the budget at NIH has doubled during this same 10-year period (9) . At least two-thirds of the increase in the NIH budget has been necessary for the grants that are approved because much more expensive research is being conducted today. Unfortunately, the number of grants being awarded from NIH to investigators 35 years old and younger is decreasing, falling from 23% of all NIH awards in 1980 to just 4% in 2000 (10, 11) .\n\n For senior investigators, the new and renewal application process is just part of your life. However, younger cardiologists often ask whether it is really necessary to do all of this. If you have such thoughts, it means you probably do not have the heart for investigation. If you make your choices based on issues relating to whether or not the situation offers more or less security, you are not an investigator.\n\n In reviewing biomedical research in the U.S., it has been unbelievably important economically as well as in every other respect, and it has had a large impact on this country. This is good news. Unfortunately, at the present time, the news regarding NIH funding is not so good. We have gone from a doubling of the NIH budget in 1999 to 2004 to a projected increase for 2005 of just 2.6%. Compounding the financial problems is the significant shift of monies from science into biodefense; while that is still funding science, it is certainly not funding the biomedical science we are used to working with as investigators. This shift in priorities is a reality and will continue for the foreseeable future. It has been projected that, to just keep up with what we were doing in terms of biomedical research, we need an 8% to 9% annual budget increase from now on, so this 2.6% increase in 2005 is a problem. Another important issue goes back to our IMGs. A very interesting paper was recently published arguing that as U.S. dominance in science decreases, reaching equivalency with Europe, there will be a greater need for IMGs (12) . This has a lot to do with progress in science depending heavily on the worldwide exchange of ideas, information, data, materials, and people. There has been a great concern, expressed in editorials published in various journals, that in many respects the U.S. has become isolated, and the common belief is that there is no need to pay attention to what is happening \n\n outside our borders. However, this is occurring at the same time that our dominance in science is being challenged by the growth of scientific research done elsewhere. One solution is to bring more IMGs into the U.S., not as clinicians but as investigators. Unfortunately, the hurdles for foreign students have gotten much greater in the last few years.\n\n Another issue worth mentioning has to do with politics. The current political scenario has been heavily criticized in terms of science, in particular the 1,000 committees who actually advise the federal government. A recent commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine noted that politicians are free to do whatever they want, but there are concerns relating to the injection of politics into science and to what extent science is a priority in the current administration (13) .\n\n The last of the major issues confronting biomedical research is the financial status of academic medical centers. Investigators in academic centers are being asked to do too many tasks, leaving too little time for creativity. This has had an incredibly negative impact on young investigators trying to find mentors.\n\n An emphasis on research offers major economic dividends to society. According to six research papers authored by nine distinguished economists working independently of each other, advances in medical research generate dramatic returns in health and in economics. Specifically, a summary report by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation documents that the \"extended healthy lives\" of Americans is in great part due to advances in medical research. While these advances consume $45 billion annually, the return on this investment is staggering. The work of the nine economists, published first in the report Exceptional Returns (14, 15) , estimated that increases in life expectancy in the U.S. between 1970 and 1990 were worth roughly $2.8 trillion a year.

One such technique is cardiac computerized tomography (CT) coronary angiography, with the diagnostic performance of the technique 64 and above detector CT scanners are well established. 5 -7 Cardiac CT for the Assessment of Pain and Plaque (CAPP) is a prospective randomized trial designed to compare CT with EST in patients with suspected stable CAD presenting to Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinics (RACPC) [ISRCTN52480460]. This article reports the clinical difference between a novel cardiac CT pathway and the traditional EST standard of care in terms of symptoms, diagnosis, and management, and 1-year follow-up.\n\n The study protocol was approved by the Office for Research Ethics Committee Northern Ireland (ORECNI) and the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust (SEHSCT) Research and Development Committee. The study was also supported by the Northern Ireland Medical Physics Agency, the Northern Ireland Cardiovascular Research Network, and the Northern Ireland Clinical Trials Unit.\n\n The CAPP trial prospectively evenly randomized 500 patients who were referred to RACPCs with symptoms of stable chest pain to EST or cardiac CT from September 2010 to November 2011. Stable chest pain was defined as troponin negative without symptoms suggestive of unstable angina. Unstable angina was defined as (i) crescendo angina (more severe, prolonged, or frequent) superimposed on a pre-existing pattern of stable, exertion-related angina pectoris, or (ii) angina pectoris at rest. 8, 9 Cardiac clinics All patients were recruited through two National Health Service (NHS) RACPCs within the one health care trust. Patients were referred by primary care physicians or non-cardiologists and were seen within 2 weeks of referral.\n\n All patients had their age, gender, risk factors, and chest pain characteristics documented. Pain type was classified as typical, atypical, or nonanginal according to defined criteria. 4, 10 This was performed by a non-investigator clinician before randomization. The probability of significant CAD was calculated from the Diamond Forrester table in CG95. 4 In keeping with this, risk factors associated with high cardiovascular risk included diabetes and/or smoking and/or a cholesterol level .6.47 mmol/L. A fasting serum total lipid profile and glucose level were sampled on the day of RACPC attendance. Details of exclusion criteria have been reported previously, 11 but in summary, there are standard contraindications to both EST and cardiac CT.\n\n All patients prior to attendance to clinic were advised to stop any ratelimiting drugs 72 h before attendance in case of randomization to the EST arm. Patients were randomized at clinic using the permuted block randomization technique.\n\n EST was performed using a standard Bruce protocol treadmill with continuous 12-lead ECG monitoring and registration at 1-min intervals. Manual blood pressure monitoring was performed every 2 min.\n\n Criteria for discontinuation of the test were ST changes of depression .0.3 mV or elevation .0.1 mV; blood pressure changes of systolic .230 mmHg or diastolic .130 mmHg or a .10 mmHg systolic blood pressure drop; arrhythmias such as sustained ventricular tachycardia, increasing frequency of polymorphic ventricular complexes, or altered atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction; and patient symptoms of exhaustion, extreme dyspnoea, or angina. EST results were classified as negative, positive, or inconclusive as defined by previous criteria. 3 \n\n Patients in the CT arm underwent both a calcium score (CS) and subsequent computerised tomography coronary angiogram (CTCA), regardless of initial CS. These were performed on a 64-detector platform (Philips Brilliance 64 Cleveland, Ohio, USA).

The CS measures the amount of calcium in the coronary arteries, which is an indicator of atherosclerosis. The CTCA provides detailed images of the coronary arteries, allowing for the detection of any blockages or narrowing.

One such technique is cardiac computerized tomography (CT) coronary angiography, with the diagnostic performance of the technique 64 and above detector CT scanners are well established. 5 -7 Cardiac CT for the Assessment of Pain and Plaque (CAPP) is a prospective randomized trial designed to compare CT with EST in patients with suspected stable CAD presenting to Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinics (RACPC) [ISRCTN52480460]. This article reports the clinical difference between a novel cardiac CT pathway and the traditional EST standard of care in terms of symptoms, diagnosis, and management, and 1-year follow-up.\n\n The study protocol was approved by the Office for Research Ethics Committee Northern Ireland (ORECNI) and the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust (SEHSCT) Research and Development Committee. The study was also supported by the Northern Ireland Medical Physics Agency, the Northern Ireland Cardiovascular Research Network, and the Northern Ireland Clinical Trials Unit.\n\n The CAPP trial prospectively evenly randomized 500 patients who were referred to RACPCs with symptoms of stable chest pain to EST or cardiac CT from September 2010 to November 2011. Stable chest pain was defined as troponin negative without symptoms suggestive of unstable angina. Unstable angina was defined as (i) crescendo angina (more severe, prolonged, or frequent) superimposed on a pre-existing pattern of stable, exertion-related angina pectoris, or (ii) angina pectoris at rest. 8, 9 Cardiac clinics All patients were recruited through two National Health Service (NHS) RACPCs within the one health care trust. Patients were referred by primary care physicians or non-cardiologists and were seen within 2 weeks of referral.\n\n All patients had their age, gender, risk factors, and chest pain characteristics documented. Pain type was classified as typical, atypical, or nonanginal according to defined criteria. 4, 10 This was performed by a non-investigator clinician before randomization. The probability of significant CAD was calculated from the Diamond Forrester table in CG95. 4 In keeping with this, risk factors associated with high cardiovascular risk included diabetes and/or smoking and/or a cholesterol level .6.47 mmol/L. A fasting serum total lipid profile and glucose level were sampled on the day of RACPC attendance. Details of exclusion criteria have been reported previously, 11 but in summary, there are standard contraindications to both EST and cardiac CT.\n\n All patients prior to attendance to clinic were advised to stop any ratelimiting drugs 72 h before attendance in case of randomization to the EST arm. Patients were randomized at clinic using the permuted block randomization technique.\n\n EST was performed using a standard Bruce protocol treadmill with continuous 12-lead ECG monitoring and registration at 1-min intervals. Manual blood pressure monitoring was performed every 2 min.\n\n Criteria for discontinuation of the test were ST changes of depression .0.3 mV or elevation .0.1 mV; blood pressure changes of systolic .230 mmHg or diastolic .130 mmHg or a .10 mmHg systolic blood pressure drop; arrhythmias such as sustained ventricular tachycardia, increasing frequency of polymorphic ventricular complexes, or altered atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction; and patient symptoms of exhaustion, extreme dyspnoea, or angina. EST results were classified as negative, positive, or inconclusive as defined by previous criteria. 3 \n\n Patients in the CT arm underwent both a calcium score (CS) and subsequent computerised tomography coronary angiogram (CTCA), regardless of initial CS. These were performed on a 64-detector platform (Philips Brilliance 64 Cleveland, Ohio, USA).

However, further research and clinical trials are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these interventions.", "paper_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19013571", "paper_title": "The year in cardiology 2015: valvular heart disease", "passage_text": "In the 26 patients who had MRI after surgery, the correlation between reverse left ventricular (LV) remodelling and indices of MR severity was much higher for MRI than for echocardiography (r \u00bc 0.85, P , 0.0001 vs. r \u00bc 0.32, P \u00bc 0.10, respectively), which tends to support the accuracy of MRI. The Mitral Valve Academic Research Consortium (MVARC) collaboration between leading academic research organizations and physician-scientists specializing in mitral valve disease from the USA and Europe aims to provide a consensus approach to uniform definitions for endpoints specific to MV interventions, and to recommend a framework for the design of clinical studies to assess transcatheter MR devices. 17, 18 The management of patients with severe secondary MR and LV dysfunction is a topic where the data currently available on the impact of different treatments are somewhat discordant. The study by Samad et al. 19 merged two large databases from Duke University putting together a record of 1441 patients with moderate to severe functional MR and LV dysfunction. This study confirmed that in current practice, medical management, which was used in 75% of patients, is the most popular strategy while coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) plus mitral valve surgery was performed in only 7% and finally mitral valve surgery in isolation in 4% of cases. Follow-up was up to 5 years and based on a clinical endpoint combining death, transplantation, or implantation of LV assist. Medical management carried only a dismal prognosis since the survival rate was only 40% at 5 years. This was not a randomized study, but a propensity adjustment showed that the use of mitral valve surgery was associated with better event-free survival than medical management. Among patients with coronary artery disease, CABG or CABG plus mitral valve surgery was associated with a better event-free survival. On the other hand, mitral valve surgery in isolation was not associated with a significant survival benefit compared with medical therapy. Among patients with coronary artery disease, mitral valve surgery offered better event-free survival over no mitral valve surgery. Among patients who underwent CABG, the combined use of mitral valve surgery showed no survival benefit. Finally, in patients without coronary artery disease, mitral valve surgery did not significantly improve outcomes when compared with medical therapy even if there was a favourable trend. These results contrast with findings in the STICH trial, but are in accordance with the CTSN trial 20 in which, however, clinical endpoints were not a primary endpoint. The present study supports the benefit of revascularization in these patients with poor LV. These conclusions also support the current recommendations, which state that mitral valve surgery can be combined in selected patients with CABG and has few indications in the absence of CABG.\n\n The 2012 ESC/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease stated that percutaneous MitraClip therapy may be considered, after heart team discussion, in high-risk patients with either primary or secondary MR. This led in current practice, in the countries where the cost of treatment is reimbursed, to a large use of the device in high-risk patients with secondary MR. Conversely, the use of MitraClip therapy is not currently recommended in secondary MR in the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology guidelines following US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advice. To help answer the debate, the efficacy of this therapy, on top of optimal medical management, is being studied in three ongoing randomized trials: COAPT in the USA, MITRA-FR 21 and RESHAPE\n\n Newcomers in interventional cardiology such as direct mitral annuloplasty 22 and, in a more distant future, transcatheter mitral valve replacement 23 ( Figure 2 ) will also play a role.\n\n In the rapidly moving field of interventions on MR, a joint position paper from the ESC Working Groups on cardiovascular surgery and valvular disease recently addressed the indications and limitations of surgical and percutaneous treatment of MR. 24 Surgery remains the reference treatment for primary MR, while percutaneous edge-to-edge repair is an alternative in symptomatic patients at high-risk or contra-indicated to surgery. Unlike in primary MR, interventions should be considered in secondary regurgitation only in patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy.\n\n Degenerative mitral stenosis is frequent in the elderly and mostly results from extensive annular calcification. The absence of commissural fusion makes it not amenable to percutaneous mitral commissurotomy.

His physical and mental development was normal. A grade 4/6 pansystolic murmur was heard over the left sternal border.\n\n Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a moderate-sized perimembranous ventricular septal defect (PmVSD) with a 14 mm \u00d7 9 mm aneurysm (Figures 1 A, B) . The diameter of the exit was 5 mm. The left atrium and ventricle were dilated. Their diameters were 35 mm and 55 mm respectively. There were mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitations. We attempted to perform a transcatheter closure of this PmVSD under general anesthesia with the guidance of fluoroscopy and echocardiography.\n\n However, a left ventricle (LV) angiogram showed that the VSD was characterized by two exits with diameters of 7 mm and 5 mm basipetally (Figure 2 A) . The entrance diameter was 18 mm. The lower VSD, measuring 5 mm, was located near the crest of the interventricular septum, and the upper VSD, measuring 7 mm, was located close (2.5 mm) to the aortic end of the septal aneurysm. The distance between the two exits was 4.5 mm.\n\n A 7 mm and a 6 mm modified double-disk symmetrical ventricular occluder (lifetech Ltd, Shenzhen, China), similar to the Amplatzer occluder, were used in this procedure. First, the upper exit was crossed from the arterial side using a 6-Fr Launcher Judkins Right 3.5 (JR3.5) guiding catheter with the use of a Terumo wire (Terumo Inc., Japan). The Terumo wire was then exchanged for a 260 cm long noodle wire (AGA Medical, Golden Valley, MN, USA). Then an arterial-venous wire loop was established from the right femoral artery to the right femoral vein via the defect as previously described. Over the wire a Lifetech delivery sheath was introduced from the femoral vein through the VSD to the LV. Under the guidance of fluoroscopy and TTE, a 7 mm double-disk symmetrical ventricular occluder was deployed across the defect. The first disc was deployed on the left ventricular side of the septum, and the catheter was pulled back to another disc on the right ventricular side of the defect. Repeated angiogram was then obtained (Figure 2 B) .\n\n The lower exit then was crossed using the same guiding catheter and wire from the left femoral artery to the left femoral vein. A 6 mm double-disc symmetrical occluder was deployed across the lower defect overlapping with the first device using the same technique, with excellent results confirmed by LV angiogram ( After the procedure, electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm. Transthoracic echocardiography after 24 h showed both devices in good position, with no residual shunt and a lesser degree of tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n The procedure was successful with confirmation by multimodality evaluation including continuous pressure recording, TTE, 3D-TTE, and ECG. During the 12-month follow-up period, there was no heart block, residual shunt, device embolization, infective endocarditis, aortic regurgitation or aggravation of tricuspid regurgitation. At the latest follow-up, the diameters of the left atrium and ventricle had decreased to 25 mm and 41 mm respectively.\n\n As the most common congenital heart disease, ventricular septal defect (VSD) accounts for 30% of all the congenital heart disease. Perimembranous VSD, a defect involving the membranous septum and the adjacent portion of the muscular septum, accounts for about 75-80% of cases. Although open heart surgery is generally ac- knowledged as the standard treatment for PmVSD, with recent increasing use of interventional therapy of VSD and the improvement of the success rate, transcatheter closure has been widely adopted and has been suggested as an attractive alternative to surgery. In this present case, the aortic angiogram revealed that the defect was perimembranous VSD with a moderate-sized aneurysm which had two exits. Several technical considerations were therefore needed. First, TTE revealed that the aneurysm was relatively long and adjacent to the tricuspid valve. PmVSD often involved the entire membranous septum and adjacent structures such as the aortic valve, tricuspid valve, chordae tendineae, atrioventricular node, and conduction bundle. Color Doppler was therefore especially important for monitoring the occurrence of aortic or tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular outflow track obstruction during the catheterization procedure. Second, the exits of VSD were relatively far apart, which would probably result in incomplete closure. Incomplete closure often occurs in multihole PmVSD with aneurysm, and occluders may need to be replaced repeatedly during the procedure [1] . Residual shunting due to incomplete closure could cause severe hemolysis requiring repeat intervention or even surgical repair [2] . Third, it was important to choose a suitable occluder. Wu et al. [3] reported an encouraging long-term outcome of 64 patients with multi-hole PmVSDs who underwent a transcatheter closure procedure with a single device using different types of VSD occluders. Retrograde closure of multiple PmVSDs using two ADO II devices was also reported [4] . Although it would make the procedure easier using the arterial route, closure by the antegrade venous approach required a larger distance between the defect and aortic valve. Furthermore, it would probably cause arterial complications and difficulties for achieving a stable position.\n\n To avoid residual shunts and the influence of aortic or tricuspid regurgitation, two double-disc symmetrical occluders were chosen to close the defect because the two exits were far apart and the aneurysm was large enough. Real-time 3D-TTE was performed to further assess the assessment of aortic and tricuspid valve function. Since deploying the devices in the aneurysm would probably cause right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, continuous pressure recording through the right ventricular outflow tract and echocardiography after the procedure were important.\n\n In conclusion, transcatheter closure of multi-hole PmVSDs with aneurysm using more than one device can be performed safely and effectively. Multimodality evaluation, especially the 3D echocardiography which accurately revealed the anatomical structure of cardiac chambers, was important in this procedure for assessing the position of occluders and avoiding an influence on adjacent structures during the procedure.", "passage_position": "0", "year": 2017.0, "venue": "Postepy w kardiologii interwencyjnej = Advances in interventional cardiology", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_19017581_0_2", "paper_id": "19017581", "question": "What are the technical considerations for transcatheter closure of perimembranous VSD with aneurysm?\n", "answer": "Some technical considerations for transcatheter closure of perimembranous VSD with aneurysm include monitoring for aortic or tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular outflow track obstruction, choosing a suitable occluder, and assessing the position of occluders using multimodality evaluation.", "paper_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:19017581", "paper_title": "Transcatheter closure of multi-hole perimembranous ventricular septal defect with aneurysm using two occluders", "passage_text": "A 33-year-old man presented to our department for recurrent respiratory tract infections since early childhood.

Transthoracic echocardiography after 24 h showed both devices in good position, with no residual shunt and a lesser degree of tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n The procedure was successful with confirmation by multimodality evaluation including continuous pressure recording, TTE, 3D-TTE, and ECG. During the 12-month follow-up period, there was no heart block, residual shunt, device embolization, infective endocarditis, aortic regurgitation or aggravation of tricuspid regurgitation. At the latest follow-up, the diameters of the left atrium and ventricle had decreased to 25 mm and 41 mm respectively.\n\n As the most common congenital heart disease, ventricular septal defect (VSD) accounts for 30% of all the congenital heart disease. Perimembranous VSD, a defect involving the membranous septum and the adjacent portion of the muscular septum, accounts for about 75-80% of cases. Although open heart surgery is generally ac- knowledged as the standard treatment for PmVSD, with recent increasing use of interventional therapy of VSD and the improvement of the success rate, transcatheter closure has been widely adopted and has been suggested as an attractive alternative to surgery. In this present case, the aortic angiogram revealed that the defect was perimembranous VSD with a moderate-sized aneurysm which had two exits. Several technical considerations were therefore needed. First, TTE revealed that the aneurysm was relatively long and adjacent to the tricuspid valve. PmVSD often involved the entire membranous septum and adjacent structures such as the aortic valve, tricuspid valve, chordae tendineae, atrioventricular node, and conduction bundle. Color Doppler was therefore especially important for monitoring the occurrence of aortic or tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular outflow track obstruction during the catheterization procedure. Second, the exits of VSD were relatively far apart, which would probably result in incomplete closure. Incomplete closure often occurs in multihole PmVSD with aneurysm, and occluders may need to be replaced repeatedly during the procedure [1] . Residual shunting due to incomplete closure could cause severe hemolysis requiring repeat intervention or even surgical repair [2] . Third, it was important to choose a suitable occluder. Wu et al. [3] reported an encouraging long-term outcome of 64 patients with multi-hole PmVSDs who underwent a transcatheter closure procedure with a single device using different types of VSD occluders. Retrograde closure of multiple PmVSDs using two ADO II devices was also reported [4] . Although it would make the procedure easier using the arterial route, closure by the antegrade venous approach required a larger distance between the defect and aortic valve. Furthermore, it would probably cause arterial complications and difficulties for achieving a stable position.\n\n To avoid residual shunts and the influence of aortic or tricuspid regurgitation, two double-disc symmetrical occluders were chosen to close the defect because the two exits were far apart and the aneurysm was large enough. Real-time 3D-TTE was performed to further assess the assessment of aortic and tricuspid valve function. Since deploying the devices in the aneurysm would probably cause right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, continuous pressure recording through the right ventricular outflow tract and echocardiography after the procedure were important.\n\n In conclusion, transcatheter closure of multi-hole PmVSDs with aneurysm using more than one device can be performed safely and effectively. Multimodality evaluation, especially the 3D echocardiography which accurately revealed the anatomical structure of cardiac chambers, was important in this procedure for assessing the position of occluders and avoiding an influence on adjacent structures during the procedure.", "passage_position": "0", "year": 2017.0, "venue": "Postepy w kardiologii interwencyjnej = Advances in interventional cardiology", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_18603562_0_2", "paper_id": "18603562", "question": "How is coronary calcification assessed and what is its relationship to CHD?\n", "answer": "Coronary calcification is assessed by electron beam tomography (EBT), which is a noninvasive measurement for atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries.

The relation between coffee consumption and CHD is not unambiguous. Studies showed a significant positive association, 2, 3 no association, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] or even an inverse association 8, 9 between coffee consumption and CHD. The effect of filtered coffee on serum lipids 10 and blood pressure is small. [11] [12] [13] Recent findings showed that coffee consumption may protect against diabetes mellitus and improve insulin sensitivity. 14 -16 Part of the beneficial effects of coffee on the cardiovascular system may be attributable to the antioxidant activity of polyphenols in coffee or minerals such as potassium and magnesium. 17 Although coffee consumption has been studied in the relation to various risk factors of CHD, it has not yet been examined in the relation to atherosclerosis. An accurate noninvasive measurement for atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries is coronary calcification assessed by electron beam tomography (EBT), because it is closely related to the amount of atherosclerotic plaque. 18 Coronary calcification has been found to predict risk of CHD. 19 Oei et al showed in 2013 participants of the Rotterdam Coronary Calcification Study that cardiovascular risk factors assessed 7 years before EBT scanning are strongly associated with coronary calcification. 20 We examined whether habitual coffee drinking was associated with coronary calcification in this older Dutch population.\n\n \n\n The Rotterdam Study is a population-based follow-up study with baseline examinations conducted between 1990 and 1993. All inhabitants of a suburb of Rotterdam, aged 55 years and over, were invited. In total 7983 men and women agreed to participate. Follow-up visits took place in 1993 to 1994 and 1997 to 1999. The aim of the Rotterdam Study is to assess the occurrence of chronic diseases in an ageing population and to clarify their determinants. The rationale and design of the Rotterdam Study have been described elsewhere. 21 The present analysis formed part of the Rotterdam Coronary Calcification Study, which is embedded in the Rotterdam Study. 20 The Rotterdam Coronary Calcification Study was designed to study the determinants and consequences of coronary calcification detected by EBT. From 1997 to 2000, noninstitutionalized participants of the Rotterdam Study who were below 86 years of age were invited to undergo an EBT scan. Scans were obtained for 2063 (response 61%) of the 3370 eligible individuals. Because of several causes, ie, metal clips from cardiac surgery, severe artifacts, registration errors, and errors pertaining to electrocardiography or image acquisition, data could not be reconstructed or analyzed in 50 subjects. Consequently, data were available for 2013 participants. We excluded 311 participants, because data on coffee consumption were missing. From the 1702 participants left, 182 participants with a history of CHD (ie, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery, or percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography) were excluded from the data analysis. Eventually, the analysis was based on 1570 participants (Figure) . The Medical Ethics Committee of Erasmus University, the Netherlands, approved the study. All participants gave informed consent.\n\n Dietary data was collected during the baseline visit between 1990 and 1993. Before the baseline center visits, the participants received a checklist on which they indicated all foods and drinks that they consumed more than once a month during the preceding year. At baseline a trained dietician interviewed the participants at the study center, using a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. 22 The aim of this interview was to obtain accurate information on amount and consumption frequency of food items noted by participants as consumed frequently in the completed checklist. Two-thirds of the dietary interviews were performed using a computer program that verified all data simultaneously. The questionnaire comprised 170 food items and all relevant beverages, including coffee. Participants reported their habitual coffee intake as number of cups per day or week. One cup of coffee was considered equal to 125 mL.\n\n Information on smoking was obtained at baseline during the home interview. We categorized subjects as present, past, or never smokers. Anthropometric measures were obtained during the visit to the research center. Blood pressure was measured at the right brachial artery with a random-zero sphygmomanometer with the participant in the sitting position. The mean of 2 consecutive measurements was used. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of \u0546140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of \u054690 mm Hg, or use of blood pressure-lowering medication for the indication hypertension.", "passage_position": "0", "year": 2008.0, "venue": "Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_18606308_0_1", "paper_id": "18606308", "question": "What are the main pathological processes of coronary atherosclerotic disease?\n", "answer": "The main pathological processes of coronary atherosclerotic disease are ruptured and eroded atherosclerotic plaques with thrombosis.

On the other hand, the endothelial integrity was reversely correlated with apoptosis score (r = \u22120.91, P < 0.001). Using One-way ANOVA model, we have further confirmed that the increased apoptosis score was linearly associated with the increased thrombotic score (F = 103.49, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 7) .\n\n By including the variables of serum lipid and hs-CRP, staurosporine concentration, endothelial apoptosis and endothelial denudation in the multiple logistic regression analysis model, we found that endothelial apoptosis was an independent risk factor for histological thrombosis and angiographic overt thrombosis (OR = 13.75, 95% CI, 2.13 ~ 94.26, P < 0.01; OR = 40.25, 95% CI, 2.59 ~ 660.74, P < 0.01).\n\n Culprit coronary atherosclerotic lesions, which are responsible for ischemic coronary disease, are usually classified into ruptured plaque, eroded plaque, or calcific nodule (Naghavi et al. 2003a; Naghavi et al. 2003b) . A study of morphological classification of atherosclerotic lesions showed that plaques histologically resembling erosion were found proximal to the ruptured site in some culprit lesions, which indicates that the identification of eroded plaques can be complicated and confusing (Virmani et al. 2000) . Aside from the absence of rupture in the fibrous cap, other main characteristics of eroded plaque are as follows: (1) endothelial denudation at the plaque/thrombus interface; (2) deep lipid pools which don't communicate with the luminal thrombus; and (3) an abundance of smooth muscle cells and proteoglycans in plaques (Virmani et al. 2000; Naghavi et al. 2003a; Naghavi et al. 2003b ). Thus, a careful assessment of the plaque with the characteristics mentioned above should be first performed before any further investigations about eroded plaque. In our study, we have identified whether the rupture of caps and lipid overflow happened by serial sections and staining, and then we have shown that endothelial apoptosis is indeed involved in the formation of thrombotic eroded atherosclerotic plaques.\n\n Staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, blocks cell metabolism, thereby inducing apoptosis. EC apoptosis triggered by staurosporine incubation or serum starvation showed similar outcomes in relation to the severity and pattern of apoptosis (Bombeli et al. 1999) . Accordingly, staurosporine was chosen as the drug for establishing the eroded plaque model in our research. In this study, we detected characteristics of staurosporine-induced plaques with serial sections and Oil Red O, \u03b1 -smooth muscle cell actin and CD31 staining.

However, with the advent of widespread use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the 1990s, it was hypothesized that AF patients free of left atrial thrombi may safely undergo a shortterm course of anticoagulation followed by early CV, thereby reducing the risk of stroke and bleeding events. In 1995, Manning et al. reported a study of 94 patients with AF O48 h duration, scheduled to undergo clinically indicated CV who had not received long-term anticoagulation.\n\n 11 TEE revealed 14 atrial thrombi in 12 patients (13%), all of whom did not undergo CV.

The Assessment of Cardioversion Using Transesophageal Echocardiography (ACUTE) pilot study was the first prospective, randomized trial to examine patients with AF of O2 days duration undergoing clinically indicated CV. 12 A total of 126 patients from 10 international clinical sites were randomized to conventional anticoagulation or a TEE-guided approach with shortterm anticoagulation. CV was postponed in 7 (13%) patients due to atrial thrombi identified on TEE. The TEE-guided strategy resulted in early CV without embolization in all patients without atrial thrombi detected on TEE. In addition, CV was performed much earlier with this strategy than with the conventional method (0.6 weeks vs. 4.7 weeks). Based on the results of this pilot study, the ACUTE multicenter trial prospectively enrolled 1222 patients with AF of O48 h duration and assigned them to TEE-guided (n \u00bc 619) or conventional therapy (n \u00bc 603). 13 Although there was no difference in the rate of embolization at 8 weeks follow-up, the TEE-guided group had a significantly lower rate of hemorrhagic events.", "passage_position": "0", "year": 2004.0, "venue": "European journal of echocardiography : the journal of the Working Group on Echocardiography of the European Society of Cardiology", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_28673355_0_3", "paper_id": "28673355", "question": "How does transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) impact the management of anticoagulation and cardioversion in patients with AF?\n", "answer": "The use of TEE allows for the visualization of left atrial thrombi in patients with AF.

In 1960, Goldman reported a 1.5% embolization event rate in 400 AF patients undergoing chemical CV who had not received anticoagulation. 5 This study proposed for the first time that anticoagulant therapy initiated prior to CV could stabilize pre-existing thrombus allowing it to organize and adhere to the atrial wall. The first report of thromboembolism associated with electrical CV occurred in 1963 when Lown et al. examined 50 AF patients. 6 In this series, 94% of patients had rheumatic heart disease and systemic embolization was reported in 1.7%. Anticoagulation therapy was restricted only to patients with mitral stenosis. A few years later, Lown reported the results of a series of 350 patients undergoing electrical CV for AF. 7 This study documented a 0.9% incidence of systemic embolization. Interestingly, only 29% of patients received anticoagulant agents and all embolic events occurred in those not receiving warfarin. The first prospective controlled study of anticoagulation in patients undergoing electrical CV was performed in 1969 by Bjerkelund and Orning. 8 In 437 patients with atrial arrhythmia, systemic thromboembolism occurred in 5.3% of patients not receiving anticoagulation compared to 0.8% of patients receiving long-term anticoagulant therapy. This study demonstrated that although anticoagulation prior to CV significantly decreases the risk of embolization, it does not eliminate it.\n\n The current recommendations for the management of anticoagulation around the time of CV were published by the American College of Chest Physicians initially in 1992 9 and then updated in 2001. 10 These conventional-therapy guidelines recommend that patients with AF of O48 h duration be treated with therapeutic levels of warfarin (INR 2-3) for 3 weeks prior to CV and continued until NSR has been maintained for at least 4 weeks. However, with the advent of widespread use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the 1990s, it was hypothesized that AF patients free of left atrial thrombi may safely undergo a shortterm course of anticoagulation followed by early CV, thereby reducing the risk of stroke and bleeding events. In 1995, Manning et al. reported a study of 94 patients with AF O48 h duration, scheduled to undergo clinically indicated CV who had not received long-term anticoagulation.\n\n 11 TEE revealed 14 atrial thrombi in 12 patients (13%), all of whom did not undergo CV.

Echocardiogram showed dilated cardiomyopathy in all cases. In addition to cardiomegaly, five of eight cases presented with complete RBBB and three with complete atrioventricular block (A-VB). The clinical category, referred to as the combined form, was characterized by the presence of both cardiomyopathy Table II .\n\n In Mexico, information on the prevalence of Chagas disease is scarce and the public health importance of the disease is debated (Velasco & Guzman 1986 , Tay et al. 1992 . A number of triatomine vectors and wild and domestic reservoirs have been identified (Cruz-Reyes et al. 2006) . Seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection in the reservoir has been reported to vary between 8% and 62% according to species and regions (Cruz-Reyes et al. 2006) . With respect to human infection, the National Seroepidemio-logical Survey (NSS) (Velasco et al. 1992 ) carried out by the official Secretar\u00eda de Salud (SSa) showed a prevalence of 1.6%, whereas independent studies carried out mainly in rural areas have shown that between 20 and 30% of the population was infected by the pathogen (Monteon & Reyes-Lopez 1989 , Tay et al. 1992 . Moreover, positive blood donors have been detected at percentages of 0.2-17% of infected persons (Ramos-Echevarria et al. 1993 , Guzman-Bracho et al. 1998 , Rangel et al. 1998 , S\u00e1nchez-Guill\u00e9n et al. 2002 , Hernandez-Becerril et al. 2005 , Kirchhoff et al. 2006 ).\n\n The seroprevalence found in blood donors from the state of Puebla (7.7%) is relatively high and comparable to those found in endemic states of others countries. These findings are in sharp contrast with the National Seroepi-demiological Survey in Mexico carried out in 1987 and published in 1992, which showed a low prevalence of 1.6%. These differences may, in part, be attributed to the fact that this last study was performed with statistics specifically designed for the characterization of transmissible urban diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis, but not for transmissible rural diseases such as Chagas disease (Ve-lasco et al. 1992) . Additionally, our findings (7.7%) contrast with the more recent study carried out by the official SSa showing only 1.5% of national prevalence and specifically 1.8% from the state of Puebla (Guzm\u00e1n-Bracho et al. 1998) .", "passage_position": "2", "year": 2006.0, "venue": "Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz", "specialty": "Cardiology"}, {"qa_id": "38_470699_0_1", "paper_id": "470699", "question": "What is the difference between white-coat hypertension and sustained hypertension?\n", "answer": "White-coat hypertension (WCH) is a condition characterized by high blood pressure readings in a clinical setting, but normal blood pressure readings when measured outside of the clinical setting.

During myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, there is evidence that increased release of endothelin-1 (ET-1) promotes cell death in the myocardium and endothelial cells. This leads to depletion of cellular L-arginine and reduced synthesis of NO, which can further enhance the release of ET-1. The balance between the actions of ET-1 and NO, as well as the reciprocal interactions between these systems, may play a role in the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.", "paper_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21738810", "paper_title": "Role of endothelin, nitric oxide and L-arginine release in ischaemia/reperfusion injury of rat heart.", "passage_text": "The endothelium produces several vasodilator and vasoconstrictor substances that regulate blood vessel tone and w x exert a number of other cardiovascular effects 1 . Two important factors produced by the endothelium are enw x dothelium-derived relaxing factor 2 , generally agreed to w x \u017d . w x be nitric oxide 3,4 , and endothelin-1 ET-1 5 . Recent studies focused on the role of the endothelium in cardiac ischaemia-reperfusion injury which is associated with considerable damage to myocytes and coronary arteries. A prominent feature of post-ischaemic endothelial cell dysfunction is a decrease in endothelium-dependent vasodilaw x tion in isolated blood vessels and intact vascular beds 6,7 , and studies into its mechanisms have implicated the NOcyclic GMP pathway. Basal release of NO from rat hearts w x appeared diminished after ischaemia and reperfusion 8, 9 , and the pathophysiological consequences due to impaired NO release were mitigated or abolished by providing w x w x exogenous NO donors 8,10 , authentic NO 11 , or the NO w x precursor L-arginine 12-14 , suggesting that cellular Larginine depletion may play a role in these defects. In other studies, however, inhibitors of NO synthase were found to exert protective, rather than injurious effects w x 15,16 , possibly via indirect mechanisms.\n\n There is now substantial evidence that the formation of w x ET-1 is enhanced during myocardial ischaemia 17 and that pretreatment of hearts with receptor antagonists reTime for primary review 22 days. 21, 22 . These discrepancies may in part relate to the balance, in a given experimental setting, of pro-ischaemic actions of ET-1, which include coronary constriction and impairment of systolic and diastolic function, and anti-ischaemic effects such as increased release of vasodilator prostanoids and endothelium-derived NO. In addition, reciprocal interactions between the ET and LargininerNO systems in conjunction with increased cytosolic free Ca 2q concentrations observed in ischaemic w x hearts 23 might be of importance. Data from cultured endothelial cells suggest that the formation of ET-1 and w x NO is increased in this condition 24,25 and that feed-back inhibition of ET-1 formation by NO may also play a role. However, the importance of these mechanisms in intact hearts subjected to ischaemia and reperfusion is not known.\n\n Based on this evidence we hypothesized that increased release of ET-1 might promote ischaemiarreperfusion injury resulting in myocardial and endothelial cell death which would secondarily lead to depletion of cellular L-arginine, withdrawal of cardioprotection due to reduced synthesis of NO, and further ET-1 release. Therefore, the \u017d . purposes of this study were 1 to determine the role of L-argininerNO and ET-1 after myocardial ischaemia with \u017d . reperfusion and 2 to relate the recovery of coronary and myocardial function after reperfusion to alterations in release of L-arginine and cyclic GMP as well as lactate \u017d . dehydrogenase LDH , an established marker of cell viability.\n\n \n\n L-arginine and L-NNA were purchased from Sigma \u017d . \u017d Vienna, Austria ; SNAP was from Tocris Cookson Bris-. tol, UK ; 2,2-diethyl-1-nitrosooxyhydrazine = 1 Na \u017d . \u017d DEArNO was from Research Biochemicals Natick, MA, . \u017d USA ; PD 142893 Ac-D-diphenylalanine-Leu-Asp-Ile-Ile-.
